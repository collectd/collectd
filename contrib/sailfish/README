Packaging and helper scripts for collectd in Sailfish.

The build required preparation of the source in full Linux PC (I used
Gentoo) and building later in MER SDK. When building directly from git
sources on MER SDK, I had problems with bison (google pointed to some
bison bug). So, to build:

* clone git repo

* In full Linux host, nor MER SDK, prepare the source files:
  * ./build.sh
  * configure
  * make -j4
  * make clean

* in MER SDK, make RPM as usual:
  * mb2 -t SailfishOS-i486 -s contrib/sailfish/collectd.spec build
