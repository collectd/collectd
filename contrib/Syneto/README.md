Syneto Collectd Plugins
================

A set of Collectd plugins published under GPL v3 by Syneto.

See the source of each plugin for detailed information about them.

Syneto engineers and passionately crafts storage arrays designed to provide outstanding performance, versatility and user experience.
Our product is based on Illumos (the opensource fork of the OpenSolaris operating system which is based on Solaris 10).
This directory contains various collectd plugins that are useful for Syneto's Storage OS, but also for various illumos derivatives
like OmniOS or OpenIndiana. Some of the scripts might also work on Solaris 10 or 11.
