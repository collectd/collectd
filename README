  * Output can be written or sent to various destinations by the following
    plugins:

    - amqp
      Sends JSON-encoded data to an Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)
      server, such as RabbitMQ.

    - csv
      Write to comma separated values (CSV) files. This needs lots of
      diskspace but is extremely portable and can be analysed with almost
      every program that can analyse anything. Even Microsoft's Excel..

    - network
      Send the data to a remote host to save the data somehow. This is useful
      for large setups where the data should be saved by a dedicated machine.

    - perl
      Of course the values are propagated to plugins written in Perl, too, so
      you can easily do weird stuff with the plugins we didn't dare think of
      ;) See collectd-perl(5).

    - python
      It's possible to implement write plugins in Python using the python
      plugin. See collectd-python(5) for details.

    - rrdcached
      Output to round-robin-database (RRD) files using the RRDtool caching
      daemon (RRDcacheD) - see rrdcached(1). That daemon provides a general
      implementation of the caching done by the `rrdtool' plugin.

    - rrdtool
      Output to round-robin-database (RRD) files using librrd. See rrdtool(1).
      This is likely the most popular destination for such values. Since
      updates to RRD-files are somewhat expensive this plugin can cache
      updates to the files and write a bunch of updates at once, which lessens
      system load a lot.

    - unixsock
      One can query the values from the unixsock plugin whenever they're
      needed. Please read collectd-unixsock(5) for a description on how that's
      done.

    - write_graphite
      Sends data to Carbon, the storage layer of Graphite using TCP or UDP. It
      can be configured to avoid logging send errors (especially useful when
      using UDP).

    - write_http
      Sends the values collected by collectd to a web-server using HTTP POST
      requests. The transmitted data is either in a form understood by the
      Exec plugin or formatted in JSON.

    - write_mongodb
      Sends data to MongoDB, a NoSQL database.

    - write_redis
      Sends the values to a Redis key-value database server.

    - write_riemann
      Sends data to Riemann, a stream processing and monitoring system.

  * Logging is, as everything in collectd, provided by plugins. The following
    plugins keep up informed about what's going on:

    - logfile
      Writes logmessages to a file or STDOUT/STDERR.

    - perl
      Log messages are propagated to plugins written in Perl as well.
      See collectd-perl(5).

    - python
      It's possible to implement log plugins in Python using the python plugin.
      See collectd-python(5) for details.

    - syslog
      Logs to the standard UNIX logging mechanism, syslog.

  * Notifications can be handled by the following plugins:

    - notify_desktop
      Send a desktop notification to a notification daemon, as defined in
      the Desktop Notification Specification. To actually display the
      notifications, notification-daemon is required.
      See http://www.galago-project.org/specs/notification/.

    - notify_email
      Send an E-mail with the notification message to the configured
      recipients.

    - exec
      Execute a program or script to handle the notification.
      See collectd-exec(5).

    - logfile
      Writes the notification message to a file or STDOUT/STDERR.

    - network
      Send the notification to a remote host to handle it somehow.

    - perl
      Notifications are propagated to plugins written in Perl as well.
      See collectd-perl(5).

    - python
      It's possible to implement notification plugins in Python using the
      python plugin. See collectd-python(5) for details.

  * Value processing can be controlled using the "filter chain" infrastructure
    and "matches" and "targets". The following plugins are available:

    - match_empty_counter
      Match counter values which are currently zero.

    - match_hashed
      Match values using a hash function of the hostname.

    - match_regex
      Match values by their identifier based on regular expressions.

    - match_timediff
      Match values with an invalid timestamp.

    - match_value
      Select values by their data sources' values.

    - target_notification
      Create and dispatch a notification.

    - target_replace
      Replace parts of an identifier using regular expressions.

    - target_scale
      Scale (multiply) values by an arbitrary value.

    - target_set
      Set (overwrite) entire parts of an identifier.

  * Miscellaneous plugins:

    - aggregation
      Selects multiple value lists based on patterns or regular expressions
      and creates new aggregated values lists from those.

    - threshold
      Checks values against configured thresholds and creates notifications if
      values are out of bounds. See collectd-threshold(5) for details.

    - uuid
      Sets the hostname to an unique identifier. This is meant for setups
      where each client may migrate to another physical host, possibly going
      through one or more name changes in the process.

  * Performance: Since collectd is running as a daemon it doesn't spend much
    time starting up again and again. With the exception of the exec plugin no
    processes are forked. Caching in output plugins, such as the rrdtool and
    network plugins, makes sure your resources are used efficiently. Also,
    since collectd is programmed multithreaded it benefits from hyperthreading
    and multicore processors and makes sure that the daemon isn't idle if only
    one plugin waits for an IO-operation to complete.

  * Once set up, hardly any maintenance is necessary. Setup is kept as easy
    as possible and the default values should be okay for most users.


Operation
---------

  * collectd's configuration file can be found at `sysconfdir'/collectd.conf.
    Run `collectd -h' for a list of builtin defaults. See `collectd.conf(5)'
    for a list of options and a syntax description.

  * When the `csv' or `rrdtool' plugins are loaded they'll write the values to
    files. The usual place for these files is beneath `/var/lib/collectd'.

  * When using some of the plugins, collectd needs to run as user root, since
    only root can do certain things, such as craft ICMP packages needed to ping
    other hosts. collectd should NOT be installed setuid root since it can be
    used to overwrite valuable files!

  * Sample scripts to generate graphs reside in `contrib/' in the source
    package or somewhere near `/usr/share/doc/collectd' in most distributions.
    Please be aware that those script are meant as a starting point for your
    own experiments.. Some of them require the `RRDs' Perl module.
    (`librrds-perl' on Debian) If you have written a more sophisticated
    solution please share it with us.

  * The RRAs of the automatically created RRD files depend on the `step'
    and `heartbeat' settings given. If change these settings you may need to
    re-create the files, losing all data. Please be aware of that when changing
    the values and read the rrdtool(1) manpage thoroughly.


collectd and chkrootkit
-----------------------

  If you are using the `dns' plugin chkrootkit(1) will report collectd as a
  packet sniffer ("<iface>: PACKET SNIFFER(/usr/sbin/collectd[<pid>])"). The
  plugin captures all UDP packets on port 53 to analyze the DNS traffic. In
  this case, collectd is a legitimate sniffer and the report should be
  considered to be a false positive. However, you might want to check that
  this really is collectd and not some other, illegitimate sniffer.


Prerequisites
-------------

  To compile collectd from source you will need:

  * Usual suspects: C compiler, linker, preprocessor, make, ...

  * A POSIX-threads (pthread) implementation.
    Since gathering some statistics is slow (network connections, slow devices,
    etc) the collectd is parallelized. The POSIX threads interface is being
    used and should be found in various implementations for hopefully all
    platforms.

  * aerotools-ng (optional)
    Used by the `aquaero' plugin. Currently, the `libaquaero5' library, which
    is used by the `aerotools-ng' toolkit, is not compiled as a shared object
    nor does it feature an installation routine. Therefore, you need to point
    collectd's configure script at the source directory of the `aerotools-ng'
    project.

Configuring / Compiling / Installing
------------------------------------

  To configure, build and install collectd with the default settings, run
  `./configure && make && make install'.  For detailed, generic instructions
  see INSTALL. For a complete list of configure options and their description,
  run `./configure --help'.

  By default, the configure script will check for all build dependencies and
  disable all plugins whose requirements cannot be fulfilled (any other plugin
  will be enabled). To enable a plugin, install missing dependencies (see
  section `Prerequisites' above) and rerun `configure'. If you specify the
  `--enable-<plugin>' configure option, the script will fail if the depen-
  dencies for the specified plugin are not met. In that case you can force the
  plugin to be built using the `--enable-<plugin>=force' configure option.
  This will most likely fail though unless you're working in a very unusual
  setup and you really know what you're doing. If you specify the
  `--disable-<plugin>' configure option, the plugin will not be built. If you
  specify the `--enable-all-plugins' or `--disable-all-plugins' configure
  options, all plugins will be enabled or disabled respectively by default.
  Explicitly enabling or disabling a plugin overwrites the default for the
  specified plugin. These options are meant for package maintainers and should
  not be used in everyday situations.

  By default, collectd will be installed into `/opt/collectd'. You can adjust
  this setting by specifying the `--prefix' configure option - see INSTALL for
  details. If you pass DESTDIR=<path> to `make install', <path> will be
  prefixed to all installation directories. This might be useful when creating
  packages for collectd.

Configuring with libjvm
-----------------------

  To determine the location of the required files of a Java installation is not
  an easy task, because the locations vary with your kernel (Linux, SunOS, …)
  and with your architecture (x86, SPARC, …) and there is no ‘java-config’
  script we could use. Configuration of the JVM library is therefore a bit
  tricky.

  The easiest way to use the `--with-java=$JAVA_HOME' option, where
  `$JAVA_HOME' is usually something like:
    /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun-1.5.0.14

  The configure script will then use find(1) to look for the following files:

    - jni.h
    - jni_md.h
    - libjvm.so

  If found, appropriate CPP-flags and LD-flags are set and the following
  library checks succeed.

  If this doesn't work for you, you have the possibility to specify CPP-flags,
  C-flags and LD-flags for the ‘Java’ plugin by hand, using the following three
  (environment) variables:

    - JAVA_CPPFLAGS
    - JAVA_CFLAGS
    - JAVA_LDFLAGS

  For example (shortened for demonstration purposes):

    ./configure JAVA_CPPFLAGS="-I$JAVA_HOME/include -I$JAVA_HOME/include/linux"

  Adding "-ljvm" to the JAVA_LDFLAGS is done automatically, you don't have to
  do that.

Crosscompiling
--------------

  To compile correctly collectd needs to be able to initialize static
  variables to NAN (Not A Number). Some C libraries, especially the GNU
  libc, have a problem with that.

  Luckily, with GCC it's possible to work around that problem: One can define
  NAN as being (0.0 / 0.0) and `isnan' as `f != f'. However, to test this
  ``implementation'' the configure script needs to compile and run a short
  test program. Obviously running a test program when doing a cross-
  compilation is, well, challenging.

  If you run into this problem, you can use the `--with-nan-emulation'
  configure option to force the use of this implementation. We can't promise
  that the compiled binary actually behaves as it should, but since NANs
  are likely never passed to the libm you have a good chance to be lucky.

  Likewise, collectd needs to know the layout of doubles in memory, in order
  to craft uniform network packets over different architectures. For this, it
  needs to know how to convert doubles into the memory layout used by x86. The
  configure script tries to figure this out by compiling and running a few
  small test programs. This is of course not possible when cross-compiling.
  You can use the `--with-fp-layout' option to tell the configure script which
  conversion method to assume. Valid arguments are:

    * `nothing'    (12345678 -> 12345678)
    * `endianflip' (12345678 -> 87654321)
    * `intswap'    (12345678 -> 56781234)
