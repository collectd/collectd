# Thanks !

Thanks for your feedback & contributions to the
[collectd project](https://collectd.org/) !

## Need help using collectd ?

Please use the
[collectd mailing list](http://mailman.verplant.org/listinfo/collectd) or the
[#collectd IRC channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#collectd).
We'd like to keep the github issue tracker for bugreports and patch reviews.

## Found a bug ?

Please mention the exact collectd version you're using, how it was installed
(built from source, or installed from packages. Where was it downloaded
from). Which operating system/architecture, distribution and version are you
running collectd on.

If collectd crashes, try to get a
[stack trace](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Core_file).

## Fixed a bug ? Want to add a feature ?

Using git/github to submit changes is not mandatory. Sending patches to the
[mailing-list](http://mailman.verplant.org/listinfo/collectd) is also fine.
In both cases, take a quick look at the
[submission guidelines](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Submitting_patches)
and the [coding style recommendations](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Coding_style).

Please try to submit **bugfixes** to the
[oldest release branch](https://github.com/collectd/collectd/milestones) on
which the bug is found, so that it gets included in every future **bugfix
release**.

Please try to submit **new features** to the master branch (which will become
the next **feature release**).
