# ruby librrd bindings

- Introduction 

This module provides ruby bindings for librrd, with functionality
comparable to the native perl bindings.  See test.rb for a script that
exercises all ruby-librrd functionality.

- Installation

Installation is standard.  Simply run:

ruby extconf.rb
make
make install

I hope this works for you.  Please let me know if you have any
problems or suggestions.  Someday when I'm feeling less lazy I'll
actually document this thing.  Thanks to Tobi for rrdtool!
