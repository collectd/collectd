TCLRRD -- A TCL interpreter extension to access the RRD library,
	  contributed to Tobias Oetiker's RRD tools.

TCLRRD adds a dynamically loadable package to the Tcl 8.x interpreter
to access all RRD functions as of RRDtool 1.0.13. All command names
and arguments are equal to those of RRDtool. They are assigned to the
namespace `Rrd', e.g.  `Rrd::create'. Return values are a bit
different from plain RRDtool behavior to enable more native Tcl
usage. Errors are mapped to the TCL_ERROR return code together with
the RRD error strings.

TCLRRD makes it easy to combine RRD use with advanced SNMP functionality
of scotty (http://wwwsnmp.cs.utwente.nl/~schoenw/scotty/). E.g., it's easy
to use some scotty code to get the counters of some interfaces by their
interface name and then use Rrd::update to store the values. Furthermore,
data source types (see RRD::create documentation) and integer value ranges
could be easily retrieved from MIB information.

TCLRRD has been written on a Linux system for use with Tcl 8.x. It should
work on many other platforms, although it has not been tested. There are
no fool proof installation procedures. Take a look at Makefile.am and
adapt it, if required.

TCLRRD has been written for RRD 1.0.13.
