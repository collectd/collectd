FLOSS License Exception 
=======================
(Adapted from http://www.mysql.com/company/legal/licensing/foss-exception.html)

I want specified Free/Libre and Open Source Software ("FLOSS")
applications to be able to use specified GPL-licensed RRDtool
libraries (the "Program") despite the fact that not all FLOSS licenses are
compatible with version 2 of the GNU General Public License (the "GPL").

As a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 2.0 of the GPL:

You are free to distribute a Derivative Work that is formed entirely from
the Program and one or more works (each, a "FLOSS Work") licensed under one
or more of the licenses listed below, as long as:

1. You obey the GPL in all respects for the Program and the Derivative
Work, except for identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which are
not derived from the Program, and which can reasonably be considered
independent and separate works in themselves,

2. all identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which are not derived
from the Program, and which can reasonably be considered independent and
separate works in themselves,

1. are distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses listed
below, and

2. the object code or executable form of those sections are
accompanied by the complete corresponding machine-readable source
code for those sections on the same medium and under the same FLOSS
license as the corresponding object code or executable forms of
those sections, and

3. any works which are aggregated with the Program or with a Derivative
Work on a volume of a storage or distribution medium in accordance with
the GPL, can reasonably be considered independent and separate works in
themselves which are not derivatives of either the Program, a Derivative
Work or a FLOSS Work.

If the above conditions are not met, then the Program may only be copied,
modified, distributed or used under the terms and conditions of the GPL.
