 * Prints the configuration tree which root is supplied, onto the I/O stream
 * which is specified.
 * Two configuration variables are exposed to adapt the way the nodes of the
 * configuration tree are indented when printed.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * ===========
 *  # ci:
 *      Address of the root node of the configuration tree to be printed.
 *
 *  # indent_max_lvl:
 *      Maximum level of indentation to be used when printing the configuration
 *      tree.
 *      For instance, if it is equal to 5, it means that each time the
 *      configuration tree is roamed down, the indentation level is incremented.
 *      Until it reaches 5 (starting at 0 for the root node), then all the nodes
 *      which are deeper in the tree are indented with an indentation level of
 *      5.
 *
 *  # indent_in_spaces:
 *      Each indentation level is translated to an initial indendation of
 *      "indent_in_spaces" space characters.
 *
 *  # fd:
 *      The I/O stream in which the configuration tree should be printed.
 *
 * Pre-requisites:
