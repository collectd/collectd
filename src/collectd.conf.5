.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This config file controls how the system statistics collection daemon
\&\fBcollectd\fR behaves. The most significant option is \fBLoadPlugin\fR, which
controls which plugins to load. These plugins ultimately define collectd's
behavior.
.PP
The syntax of this config file is similar to the config file of the famous
\&\fIApache\fR webserver. Each line contains either an option (a key and a list of
one or more values) or a section-start or \-end. Empty lines and everything
after a non-quoted hash-symbol (\f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR) is ignored. \fIKeys\fR are unquoted
strings, consisting only of alphanumeric characters and the underscore (\f(CW\*(C`_\*(C'\fR)
character. Keys are handled case insensitive by \fIcollectd\fR itself and all
plugins included with it. \fIValues\fR can either be an \fIunquoted string\fR, a
\&\fIquoted string\fR (enclosed in double-quotes) a \fInumber\fR or a \fIboolean\fR
expression. \fIUnquoted strings\fR consist of only alphanumeric characters and
underscores (\f(CW\*(C`_\*(C'\fR) and do not need to be quoted. \fIQuoted strings\fR are
enclosed in double quotes (\f(CW\*(C`"\*(C'\fR). You can use the backslash character (\f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR)
to include double quotes as part of the string. \fINumbers\fR can be specified in
decimal and floating point format (using a dot \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR as decimal separator),
hexadecimal when using the \f(CW\*(C`0x\*(C'\fR prefix and octal with a leading zero (\f(CW0\fR).
\&\fIBoolean\fR values are either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR.
.PP
Lines may be wrapped by using \f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR as the last character before the newline.
This allows long lines to be split into multiple lines. Quoted strings may be
wrapped as well. However, those are treated special in that whitespace at the
beginning of the following lines will be ignored, which allows for nicely
indenting the wrapped lines.
.PP
The configuration is read and processed in order, i.e. from top to bottom. So
the plugins are loaded in the order listed in this config file. It is a good
idea to load any logging plugins first in order to catch messages from plugins
during configuration. Also, the \f(CW\*(C`LoadPlugin\*(C'\fR option \fBmust\fR occur \fBbefore\fR
the appropriate \f(CW\*(C`<Plugin ...>\*(C'\fR block.
.SH "GLOBAL OPTIONS"
.IX Header "GLOBAL OPTIONS"
.IP "\fBBaseDir\fR \fIDirectory\fR" 4
.IX Item "BaseDir Directory"
Sets the base directory. This is the directory beneath all RRD-files are
created. Possibly more subdirectories are created. This is also the working
directory for the daemon.
.IP "\fBLoadPlugin\fR \fIPlugin\fR" 4
.IX Item "LoadPlugin Plugin"
Loads the plugin \fIPlugin\fR. There must be at least one such line or \fBcollectd\fR
will be mostly useless.
.Sp
Starting with collectd 4.9, this may also be a block in which further options
affecting the behavior of \fBLoadPlugin\fR may be specified. The following
options are allowed inside a \fBLoadPlugin\fR block:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&  <LoadPlugin perl>
\&    Globals true
\&    Interval 10
\&  </LoadPlugin>
.Ve
.RS 4
.IP "\fBGlobals\fR \fBtrue|false\fR" 4
.IX Item "Globals true|false"
If enabled, collectd will export all global symbols of the plugin (and of all
libraries loaded as dependencies of the plugin) and, thus, makes those symbols
available for resolving unresolved symbols in subsequently loaded plugins if
that is supported by your system.
.Sp
This is useful (or possibly even required), e.g., when loading a plugin that
embeds some scripting language into the daemon (e.g. the \fIPerl\fR and
\&\fIPython plugins\fR). Scripting languages usually provide means to load
extensions written in C. Those extensions require symbols provided by the
interpreter, which is loaded as a dependency of the respective collectd plugin.
See the documentation of those plugins (e.g., \fIcollectd\-perl\fR\|(5) or
\&\fIcollectd\-python\fR\|(5)) for details.
.Sp
By default, this is disabled. As a special exception, if the plugin name is
either \f(CW\*(C`perl\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`python\*(C'\fR, the default is changed to enabled in order to keep
the average user from ever having to deal with this low level linking stuff.
.IP "\fBInterval\fR \fISeconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "Interval Seconds"
Sets a plugin-specific interval for collecting metrics. This overrides the
global \fBInterval\fR setting. If a plugin provides own support for specifying an
interval, that setting will take precedence.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "\fBInclude\fR \fIPath\fR [\fIpattern\fR]" 4
.IX Item "Include Path [pattern]"
If \fIPath\fR points to a file, includes that file. If \fIPath\fR points to a
directory, recursively includes all files within that directory and its
subdirectories. If the \f(CW\*(C`wordexp\*(C'\fR function is available on your system,
shell-like wildcards are expanded before files are included. This means you can
use statements like the following:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  Include "/etc/collectd.d/*.conf"
.Ve
.Sp
If the \f(CW\*(C`fnmatch\*(C'\fR function is available on your system, a shell-like wildcard
\&\fIpattern\fR may be specified to filter which files to include. This may be used
in combination with recursively including a directory to easily be able to
arbitrarily mix configuration files and other documents (e.g. \s-1README\s0 files).
The following statement is similar to the example above but includes all files
matching \f(CW\*(C`*.conf\*(C'\fR in any subdirectory of \f(CW\*(C`/etc/collectd.d\*(C'\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  Include "/etc/collectd.d" "*.conf"
.Ve
.Sp
If more than one files are included by a single \fBInclude\fR option, the files
will be included in lexicographical order (as defined by the \f(CW\*(C`strcmp\*(C'\fR
function). Thus, you can e.\ g. use numbered prefixes to specify the
order in which the files are loaded.
.Sp
To prevent loops and shooting yourself in the foot in interesting ways the
nesting is limited to a depth of 8\ levels, which should be sufficient for
most uses. Since symlinks are followed it is still possible to crash the daemon
by looping symlinks. In our opinion significant stupidity should result in an
appropriate amount of pain.
.Sp
It is no problem to have a block like \f(CW\*(C`<Plugin foo>\*(C'\fR in more than one
file, but you cannot include files from within blocks.
.IP "\fBPIDFile\fR \fIFile\fR" 4
.IX Item "PIDFile File"
Sets where to write the \s-1PID\s0 file to. This file is overwritten when it exists
and deleted when the program is stopped. Some init-scripts might override this
setting using the \fB\-P\fR command-line option.
.IP "\fBPluginDir\fR \fIDirectory\fR" 4
.IX Item "PluginDir Directory"
Path to the plugins (shared objects) of collectd.
.IP "\fBTypesDB\fR \fIFile\fR [\fIFile\fR ...]" 4
.IX Item "TypesDB File [File ...]"
Set one or more files that contain the data-set descriptions. See
\&\fItypes.db\fR\|(5) for a description of the format of this file.
.IP "\fBInterval\fR \fISeconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "Interval Seconds"
Configures the interval in which to query the read plugins. Obviously smaller
values lead to a higher system load produced by collectd, while higher values
lead to more coarse statistics.
.Sp
\&\fBWarning:\fR You should set this once and then never touch it again. If you do,
\&\fIyou will have to delete all your \s-1RRD\s0 files\fR or know some serious RRDtool
magic! (Assuming you're using the \fIRRDtool\fR or \fIRRDCacheD\fR plugin.)
.IP "\fBTimeout\fR \fIIterations\fR" 4
.IX Item "Timeout Iterations"
Consider a value list \*(L"missing\*(R" when no update has been read or received for
\&\fIIterations\fR iterations. By default, \fIcollectd\fR considers a value list
missing when no update has been received for twice the update interval. Since
this setting uses iterations, the maximum allowed time without update depends
on the \fIInterval\fR information contained in each value list. This is used in
the \fIThreshold\fR configuration to dispatch notifications about missing values,
see \fIcollectd\-threshold\fR\|(5) for details.
.IP "\fBReadThreads\fR \fINum\fR" 4
.IX Item "ReadThreads Num"
Number of threads to start for reading plugins. The default value is \fB5\fR, but
you may want to increase this if you have more than five plugins that take a
long time to read. Mostly those are plugins that do network-IO. Setting this to
a value higher than the number of registered read callbacks is not recommended.
.IP "\fBWriteThreads\fR \fINum\fR" 4
.IX Item "WriteThreads Num"
Number of threads to start for dispatching value lists to write plugins. The
default value is \fB5\fR, but you may want to increase this if you have more than
five plugins that may take relatively long to write to.
.IP "\fBHostname\fR \fIName\fR" 4
.IX Item "Hostname Name"
Sets the hostname that identifies a host. If you omit this setting, the
hostname will be determined using the \fIgethostname\fR\|(2) system call.
.IP "\fBFQDNLookup\fR \fBtrue|false\fR" 4
.IX Item "FQDNLookup true|false"
If \fBHostname\fR is determined automatically this setting controls whether or not
the daemon should try to figure out the \*(L"fully qualified domain name\*(R", \s-1FQDN\s0.
This is done using a lookup of the name returned by \f(CW\*(C`gethostname\*(C'\fR. This option
is enabled by default.
.IP "\fBPreCacheChain\fR \fIChainName\fR" 4
.IX Item "PreCacheChain ChainName"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBPostCacheChain\fR \fIChainName\fR" 4
.IX Item "PostCacheChain ChainName"
.PD
Configure the name of the \*(L"pre-cache chain\*(R" and the \*(L"post-cache chain\*(R". Please
see \*(L"\s-1FILTER\s0 \s-1CONFIGURATION\s0\*(R" below on information on chains and how these
setting change the daemon's behavior.
.SH "PLUGIN OPTIONS"
.IX Header "PLUGIN OPTIONS"
Some plugins may register own options. These options must be enclosed in a
\&\f(CW\*(C`Plugin\*(C'\fR\-Section. Which options exist depends on the plugin used. Some plugins
require external configuration, too. The \f(CW\*(C`apache plugin\*(C'\fR, for example,
required \f(CW\*(C`mod_status\*(C'\fR to be configured in the webserver you're going to
collect data from. These plugins are listed below as well, even if they don't
require any configuration within collectd's configuration file.
.PP
A list of all plugins and a short summary for each plugin can be found in the
\&\fI\s-1README\s0\fR file shipped with the sourcecode and hopefully binary packets as
well.
.ie n .SS "Plugin ""aggregation"""
.el .SS "Plugin \f(CWaggregation\fP"
.IX Subsection "Plugin aggregation"
The \fIAggregation plugin\fR makes it possible to aggregate several values into
one using aggregation functions such as \fIsum\fR, \fIaverage\fR, \fImin\fR and \fImax\fR.
This can be put to a wide variety of uses, e.g. average and total \s-1CPU\s0
statistics for your entire fleet.
.PP
The grouping is powerful but, as with many powerful tools, may be a bit
difficult to wrap your head around. The grouping will therefore be
demonstrated using an example: The average and sum of the \s-1CPU\s0 usage across
all CPUs of each host is to be calculated.
.PP
To select all the affected values for our example, set \f(CW\*(C`Plugin cpu\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`Type cpu\*(C'\fR. The other values are left unspecified, meaning \*(L"all values\*(R". The
\&\fIHost\fR, \fIPlugin\fR, \fIPluginInstance\fR, \fIType\fR and \fITypeInstance\fR options
work as if they were specified in the \f(CW\*(C`WHERE\*(C'\fR clause of an \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR \s-1SQL\s0
statement.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  Plugin "cpu"
\&  Type "cpu"
.Ve
.PP
Although the \fIHost\fR, \fIPluginInstance\fR (\s-1CPU\s0 number, i.e. 0, 1, 2, ...)  and
\&\fITypeInstance\fR (idle, user, system, ...) fields are left unspecified in the
example, the intention is to have a new value for each host / type instance
pair. This is achieved by \*(L"grouping\*(R" the values using the \f(CW\*(C`GroupBy\*(C'\fR option.
It can be specified multiple times to group by more than one field.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  GroupBy "Host"
\&  GroupBy "TypeInstance"
.Ve
.PP
We do neither specify nor group by \fIplugin instance\fR (the \s-1CPU\s0 number), so all
metrics that differ in the \s-1CPU\s0 number only will be aggregated. Each
aggregation needs \fIat least one\fR such field, otherwise no aggregation would
take place.
.PP
The full example configuration looks like this:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& <Plugin "aggregation">
\&   <Aggregation>
\&     Plugin "cpu"
\&     Type "cpu"
\&     
\&     GroupBy "Host"
\&     GroupBy "TypeInstance"
\&     
\&     CalculateSum true
\&     CalculateAverage true
\&   </Aggregation>
\& </Plugin>
.Ve
.PP
There are a couple of limitations you should be aware of:
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \fIType\fR cannot be left unspecified, because it is not reasonable to add
apples to oranges. Also, the internal lookup structure won't work if you try
to group by type.
.IP "\(bu" 4
There must be at least one unspecified, ungrouped field. Otherwise nothing
will be aggregated.
.PP
As you can see in the example above, each aggregation has its own
\&\fBAggregation\fR block. You can have multiple aggregation blocks and aggregation
blocks may match the same values, i.e. one value list can update multiple
aggregations. The following options are valid inside \fBAggregation\fR blocks:
.IP "\fBHost\fR \fIHost\fR" 4
.IX Item "Host Host"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBPlugin\fR \fIPlugin\fR" 4

.IX Item "Type Type"
.IP "\fBTypeInstance\fR \fITypeInstance\fR" 4
.IX Item "TypeInstance TypeInstance"
.PD
Selects the value lists to be added to this aggregation. \fBType\fR must be a
valid data set name, see \fItypes.db\fR\|(5) for details.
.Sp
If the string starts with and ends with a slash (\f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR), the string is
interpreted as a \fIregular expression\fR. The regex flavor used are \s-1POSIX\s0
extended regular expressions as described in \fIregex\fR\|(7). Example usage:
.Sp
.Vb 1

.Ve

group by multiple fields.

.PD
Sets the appropriate part of the identifier to the provided string.
.Sp
The \fIPluginInstance\fR should include the placeholder \f(CW\*(C`%{aggregation}\*(C'\fR which
will be replaced with the aggregation function, e.g. \*(L"average\*(R". Not including
the placeholder will result in duplication warnings and/or messed up values if
more than one aggregation function are enabled.

blocks, which configure sending and receiving of values respectively. The two
blocks are very similar, so unless otherwise noted, an option can be used in
either block. The name given in the blocks starting tag is only used for
reporting messages, but may be used to support \fIflushing\fR of certain
\&\fIPublish\fR blocks in the future.
.IP "\fBHost\fR \fIHost\fR" 4
.IX Item "Host Host"
Hostname or IP-address of the \s-1AMQP\s0 broker. Defaults to the default behavior of
the underlying communications library, \fIrabbitmq-c\fR, which is \*(L"localhost\*(R".
.IP "\fBPort\fR \fIPort\fR" 4
.IX Item "Port Port"
Service name or port number on which the \s-1AMQP\s0 broker accepts connections. This
argument must be a string, even if the numeric form is used. Defaults to
\&\*(L"5672\*(R".
.IP "\fBVHost\fR \fIVHost\fR" 4
.IX Item "VHost VHost"
Name of the \fIvirtual host\fR on the \s-1AMQP\s0 broker to use. Defaults to \*(L"/\*(R".
.IP "\fBUser\fR \fIUser\fR" 4
.IX Item "User User"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBPassword\fR \fIPassword\fR" 4
.IX Item "Password Password"
.PD
Credentials used to authenticate to the \s-1AMQP\s0 broker. By default \*(L"guest\*(R"/\*(L"guest\*(R"
is used.
.IP "\fBExchange\fR \fIExchange\fR" 4
.IX Item "Exchange Exchange"
In \fIPublish\fR blocks, this option specifies the \fIexchange\fR to send values to.
By default, \*(L"amq.fanout\*(R" will be used.
.Sp
In \fISubscribe\fR blocks this option is optional. If given, a \fIbinding\fR between
the given exchange and the \fIqueue\fR is created, using the \fIrouting key\fR if
configured. See the \fBQueue\fR and \fBRoutingKey\fR options below.
.IP "\fBExchangeType\fR \fIType\fR" 4
.IX Item "ExchangeType Type"
If given, the plugin will try to create the configured \fIexchange\fR with this
\&\fItype\fR after connecting. When in a \fISubscribe\fR block, the \fIqueue\fR will then
be bound to this exchange.
.IP "\fBQueue\fR \fIQueue\fR (Subscribe only)" 4
.IX Item "Queue Queue (Subscribe only)"
Configures the \fIqueue\fR name to subscribe to. If no queue name was configures
explicitly, a unique queue name will be created by the broker.
.IP "\fBRoutingKey\fR \fIKey\fR" 4
.IX Item "RoutingKey Key"
In \fIPublish\fR blocks, this configures the routing key to set on all outgoing
messages. If not given, the routing key will be computed from the \fIidentifier\fR
of the value. The host, plugin, type and the two instances are concatenated
together using dots as the separator and all containing dots replaced with
slashes. For example \*(L"collectd.host/example/com.cpu.0.cpu.user\*(R". This makes it
possible to receive only specific values using a \*(L"topic\*(R" exchange.
.Sp
In \fISubscribe\fR blocks, configures the \fIrouting key\fR used when creating a
\&\fIbinding\fR between an \fIexchange\fR and the \fIqueue\fR. The usual wildcards can be
used to filter messages when using a \*(L"topic\*(R" exchange. If you're only
interested in \s-1CPU\s0 statistics, you could use the routing key \*(L"collectd.*.cpu.#\*(R"
for example.
.IP "\fBPersistent\fR \fBtrue\fR|\fBfalse\fR (Publish only)" 4
.IX Item "Persistent true|false (Publish only)"
Selects the \fIdelivery method\fR to use. If set to \fBtrue\fR, the \fIpersistent\fR
mode will be used, i.e. delivery is guaranteed. If set to \fBfalse\fR (the
default), the \fItransient\fR delivery mode will be used, i.e. messages may be
lost due to high load, overflowing queues or similar issues.
.IP "\fBFormat\fR \fBCommand\fR|\fB\s-1JSON\s0\fR|\fBGraphite\fR (Publish only)" 4
.IX Item "Format Command|JSON|Graphite (Publish only)"
Selects the format in which messages are sent to the broker. If set to
\&\fBCommand\fR (the default), values are sent as \f(CW\*(C`PUTVAL\*(C'\fR commands which are
identical to the syntax used by the \fIExec\fR and \fIUnixSock plugins\fR. In this
case, the \f(CW\*(C`Content\-Type\*(C'\fR header field will be set to \f(CW\*(C`text/collectd\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If set to \fB\s-1JSON\s0\fR, the values are encoded in the \fIJavaScript Object Notation\fR,
an easy and straight forward exchange format. The \f(CW\*(C`Content\-Type\*(C'\fR header field
will be set to \f(CW\*(C`application/json\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If set to \fBGraphite\fR, values are encoded in the \fIGraphite\fR format, which is
\&\*(L"<metric> <value> <timestamp>\en\*(R". The \f(CW\*(C`Content\-Type\*(C'\fR header field will be set to
\&\f(CW\*(C`text/graphite\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
A subscribing client \fIshould\fR use the \f(CW\*(C`Content\-Type\*(C'\fR header field to
determine how to decode the values. Currently, the \fI\s-1AMQP\s0 plugin\fR itself can
only decode the \fBCommand\fR format.
.IP "\fBStoreRates\fR \fBtrue\fR|\fBfalse\fR (Publish only)" 4
.IX Item "StoreRates true|false (Publish only)"
Determines whether or not \f(CW\*(C`COUNTER\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`DERIVE\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`ABSOLUTE\*(C'\fR data sources
are converted to a \fIrate\fR (i.e. a \f(CW\*(C`GAUGE\*(C'\fR value). If set to \fBfalse\fR (the
default), no conversion is performed. Otherwise the conversion is performed
using the internal value cache.
.Sp
Please note that currently this option is only used if the \fBFormat\fR option has
been set to \fB\s-1JSON\s0\fR.
.IP "\fBGraphitePrefix\fR (Publish and \fBFormat\fR=\fIGraphite\fR only)" 4
.IX Item "GraphitePrefix (Publish and Format=Graphite only)"
A prefix can be added in the metric name when outputting in the \fIGraphite\fR format.
It's added before the \fIHost\fR name.
Metric name will be \*(L"<prefix><host><postfix><plugin><type><name>\*(R"
.IP "\fBGraphitePostfix\fR (Publish and \fBFormat\fR=\fIGraphite\fR only)" 4
.IX Item "GraphitePostfix (Publish and Format=Graphite only)"
A postfix can be added in the metric name when outputting in the \fIGraphite\fR format.
It's added after the \fIHost\fR name.
Metric name will be \*(L"<prefix><host><postfix><plugin><type><name>\*(R"
.IP "\fBGraphiteEscapeChar\fR (Publish and \fBFormat\fR=\fIGraphite\fR only)" 4
.IX Item "GraphiteEscapeChar (Publish and Format=Graphite only)"
Specify a character to replace dots (.) in the host part of the metric name.
In \fIGraphite\fR metric name, dots are used as separators between different
metric parts (host, plugin, type).
Default is \*(L"_\*(R" (\fIUnderscore\fR).
.ie n .SS "Plugin ""apache"""
.el .SS "Plugin \f(CWapache\fP"
.IX Subsection "Plugin apache"
To configure the \f(CW\*(C`apache\*(C'\fR\-plugin you first need to configure the Apache
webserver correctly. The Apache-plugin \f(CW\*(C`mod_status\*(C'\fR needs to be loaded and
working and the \f(CW\*(C`ExtendedStatus\*(C'\fR directive needs to be \fBenabled\fR. You can use
the following snipped to base your Apache config upon:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  ExtendedStatus on
\&  <IfModule mod_status.c>
\&    <Location /mod_status>
\&      SetHandler server\-status
\&    </Location>
\&  </IfModule>
.Ve
.PP
Since its \f(CW\*(C`mod_status\*(C'\fR module is very similar to Apache's, \fBlighttpd\fR is
also supported. It introduces a new field, called \f(CW\*(C`BusyServers\*(C'\fR, to count the
number of currently connected clients. This field is also supported.
.PP
The configuration of the \fIApache\fR plugin consists of one or more
\&\f(CW\*(C`<Instance\ />\*(C'\fR blocks. Each block requires one string argument
as the instance name. For example:
.PP
.Vb 8
\& <Plugin "apache">
\&   <Instance "www1">
\&     URL "http://www1.example.com/mod_status?auto"
\&   </Instance>
\&   <Instance "www2">
\&     URL "http://www2.example.com/mod_status?auto"
\&   </Instance>
\& </Plugin>
.Ve
.PP
The instance name will be used as the \fIplugin instance\fR. To emulate the old
(version\ 4) behavior, you can use an empty string (""). In order for the
plugin to work correctly, each instance name must be unique. This is not
enforced by the plugin and it is your responsibility to ensure it.
.PP
The following options are accepted within each \fIInstance\fR block:
.IP "\fB\s-1URL\s0\fR \fIhttp://host/mod_status?auto\fR" 4
.IX Item "URL http://host/mod_status?auto"
Sets the \s-1URL\s0 of the \f(CW\*(C`mod_status\*(C'\fR output. This needs to be the output generated
by \f(CW\*(C`ExtendedStatus on\*(C'\fR and it needs to be the machine readable output
generated by appending the \f(CW\*(C`?auto\*(C'\fR argument. This option is \fImandatory\fR.
.IP "\fBUser\fR \fIUsername\fR" 4
.IX Item "User Username"
Optional user name needed for authentication.
.IP "\fBPassword\fR \fIPassword\fR" 4
.IX Item "Password Password"
Optional password needed for authentication.
.IP "\fBVerifyPeer\fR \fBtrue|false\fR" 4
.IX Item "VerifyPeer true|false"
Enable or disable peer \s-1SSL\s0 certificate verification. See
<http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html> for details. Enabled by default.
.IP "\fBVerifyHost\fR \fBtrue|false\fR" 4
.IX Item "VerifyHost true|false"
Enable or disable peer host name verification. If enabled, the plugin checks
if the \f(CW\*(C`Common Name\*(C'\fR or a \f(CW\*(C`Subject Alternate Name\*(C'\fR field of the \s-1SSL\s0
certificate matches the host name provided by the \fB\s-1URL\s0\fR option. If this
identity check fails, the connection is aborted. Obviously, only works when
connecting to a \s-1SSL\s0 enabled server. Enabled by default.
.IP "\fBCACert\fR \fIFile\fR" 4
.IX Item "CACert File"
File that holds one or more \s-1SSL\s0 certificates. If you want to use \s-1HTTPS\s0 you will
possibly need this option. What \s-1CA\s0 certificates come bundled with \f(CW\*(C`libcurl\*(C'\fR

.IX Subsection "Plugin bind"
Starting with \s-1BIND\s0 9.5.0, the most widely used \s-1DNS\s0 server software provides
extensive statistics about queries, responses and lots of other information.
The bind plugin retrieves this information that's encoded in \s-1XML\s0 and provided
via \s-1HTTP\s0 and submits the values to collectd.
.PP
To use this plugin, you first need to tell \s-1BIND\s0 to make this information
available. This is done with the \f(CW\*(C`statistics\-channels\*(C'\fR configuration option:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& statistics\-channels {
\&   inet localhost port 8053;
\& };
.Ve
.PP
The configuration follows the grouping that can be seen when looking at the
data with an \s-1XSLT\s0 compatible viewer, such as a modern web browser. It's
probably a good idea to make yourself familiar with the provided values, so you
can understand what the collected statistics actually mean.

\&\fBlibyajl\fR (<http://www.lloydforge.org/projects/yajl/>) to retrieve \s-1JSON\s0 data
via cURL. This can be used to collect values from CouchDB documents (which are
stored \s-1JSON\s0 notation), for example.

a \s-1URL\s0 to be fetched via \s-1HTTP\s0 (using libcurl) and one or more \fBKey\fR blocks.
The \fBKey\fR string argument must be in a path format, which is used to collect a

Within each \fB\s-1URL\s0\fR block, there must be one or more \fBXPath\fR blocks. Each
\&\fBXPath\fR block specifies how to get one type of information. The string
argument must be a valid XPath expression which returns a list of \*(L"base

.Sp
Within the \fBXPath\fR block the following options are accepted:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBType\fR \fIType\fR" 4
.IX Item "Type Type"
Specifies the \fIType\fR used for submitting patches. This determines the number
of values that are required / expected and whether the strings are parsed as
signed or unsigned integer or as double values. See \fItypes.db\fR\|(5) for details.
This option is required.
.IP "\fBInstancePrefix\fR \fIInstancePrefix\fR" 4

Prefix the \fItype instance\fR with \fIInstancePrefix\fR. The values are simply
concatenated together without any separator.
This option is optional.
.IP "\fBInstanceFrom\fR \fIInstanceFrom\fR" 4
.IX Item "InstanceFrom InstanceFrom"
Specifies a XPath expression to use for determining the \fItype instance\fR. The
XPath expression must return exactly one element. The element's value is then

.ie n .SS "Plugin ""dbi"""
.el .SS "Plugin \f(CWdbi\fP"
.IX Subsection "Plugin dbi"
This plugin uses the \fBdbi\fR library (<http://libdbi.sourceforge.net/>) to
connect to various databases, execute \fI\s-1SQL\s0\fR statements and read back the
results. \fIdbi\fR is an acronym for \*(L"database interface\*(R" in case you were
wondering about the name. You can configure how each column is to be
interpreted and the plugin will generate one or more data sets from each row
returned according to these rules.
.PP
Because the plugin is very generic, the configuration is a little more complex
than those of other plugins. It usually looks something like this:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&  <Plugin dbi>
\&    <Query "out_of_stock">
\&      Statement "SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS value FROM products WHERE in_stock = 0 GROUP BY category"
\&      # Use with MySQL 5.0.0 or later
\&      MinVersion 50000
\&      <Result>
\&        Type "gauge"
\&        InstancePrefix "out_of_stock"
\&        InstancesFrom "category"
\&        ValuesFrom "value"
\&      </Result>
\&    </Query>
\&    <Database "product_information">
\&      Driver "mysql"
\&      DriverOption "host" "localhost"
\&      DriverOption "username" "collectd"
\&      DriverOption "password" "aZo6daiw"
\&      DriverOption "dbname" "prod_info"
\&      SelectDB "prod_info"
\&      Query "out_of_stock"
\&    </Database>
\&  </Plugin>
.Ve
.PP
The configuration above defines one query with one result and one database. The
query is then linked to the database with the \fBQuery\fR option \fIwithin\fR the
\&\fB<Database>\fR block. You can have any number of queries and databases
and you can also use the \fBInclude\fR statement to split up the configuration
file in multiple, smaller files. However, the \fB<Query>\fR block \fImust\fR
precede the \fB<Database>\fR blocks, because the file is interpreted from
top to bottom!
.PP
The following is a complete list of options:
.PP
\fI\f(BIQuery\fI blocks\fR
.IX Subsection "Query blocks"
.PP
Query blocks define \fI\s-1SQL\s0\fR statements and how the returned data should be
interpreted. They are identified by the name that is given in the opening line
of the block. Thus the name needs to be unique. Other than that, the name is
not used in collectd.
.PP
In each \fBQuery\fR block, there is one or more \fBResult\fR blocks. \fBResult\fR blocks
define which column holds which value or instance information. You can use
multiple \fBResult\fR blocks to create multiple values from one returned row. This
is especially useful, when queries take a long time and sending almost the same
query again and again is not desirable.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&  <Query "environment">
\&    Statement "select station, temperature, humidity from environment"
\&    <Result>
\&      Type "temperature"
\&      # InstancePrefix "foo"
\&      InstancesFrom "station"
\&      ValuesFrom "temperature"
\&    </Result>
\&    <Result>
\&      Type "humidity"
\&      InstancesFrom "station"
\&      ValuesFrom "humidity"
\&    </Result>
\&  </Query>
.Ve
.PP
The following options are accepted:
.IP "\fBStatement\fR \fI\s-1SQL\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "Statement SQL"
Sets the statement that should be executed on the server. This is \fBnot\fR
interpreted by collectd, but simply passed to the database server. Therefore,
the \s-1SQL\s0 dialect that's used depends on the server collectd is connected to.
.Sp
The query has to return at least two columns, one for the instance and one
value. You cannot omit the instance, even if the statement is guaranteed to
always return exactly one line. In that case, you can usually specify something
like this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  Statement "SELECT \e"instance\e", COUNT(*) AS value FROM table"
.Ve
.Sp
(That works with MySQL but may not be valid \s-1SQL\s0 according to the spec. If you
use a more strict database server, you may have to select from a dummy table or
something.)
.Sp
Please note that some databases, for example \fBOracle\fR, will fail if you
include a semicolon at the end of the statement.
.IP "\fBMinVersion\fR \fIVersion\fR" 4
.IX Item "MinVersion Version"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBMaxVersion\fR \fIValue\fR" 4
.IX Item "MaxVersion Value"
.PD
Only use this query for the specified database version. You can use these
options to provide multiple queries with the same name but with a slightly
different syntax. The plugin will use only those queries, where the specified
minimum and maximum versions fit the version of the database in use.
.Sp
The database version is determined by \f(CW\*(C`dbi_conn_get_engine_version\*(C'\fR, see the
<libdbi documentation>
for details. Basically, each part of the version is assumed to be in the range
from \fB00\fR to \fB99\fR and all dots are removed. So version \*(L"4.1.2\*(R" becomes
\&\*(L"40102\*(R", version \*(L"5.0.42\*(R" becomes \*(L"50042\*(R".
.Sp
\&\fBWarning:\fR The plugin will use \fBall\fR matching queries, so if you specify
multiple queries with the same name and \fBoverlapping\fR ranges, weird stuff will
happen. Don't to it! A valid example would be something along these lines:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&  MinVersion 40000
\&  MaxVersion 49999
\&  ...
\&  MinVersion 50000
\&  MaxVersion 50099
\&  ...
\&  MinVersion 50100
\&  # No maximum
.Ve
.Sp
In the above example, there are three ranges that don't overlap. The last one
goes from version \*(L"5.1.0\*(R" to infinity, meaning \*(L"all later versions\*(R". Versions
before \*(L"4.0.0\*(R" are not specified.
.IP "\fBType\fR \fIType\fR" 4
.IX Item "Type Type"
The \fBtype\fR that's used for each line returned. See \fItypes.db\fR\|(5) for more
details on how types are defined. In short: A type is a predefined layout of
data and the number of values and type of values has to match the type
definition.
.Sp
If you specify \*(L"temperature\*(R" here, you need exactly one gauge column. If you
specify \*(L"if_octets\*(R", you will need two counter columns. See the \fBValuesFrom\fR
setting below.
.Sp
There must be exactly one \fBType\fR option inside each \fBResult\fR block.
.IP "\fBInstancePrefix\fR \fIprefix\fR" 4
.IX Item "InstancePrefix prefix"
Prepends \fIprefix\fR to the type instance. If \fBInstancesFrom\fR (see below) is not
given, the string is simply copied. If \fBInstancesFrom\fR is given, \fIprefix\fR and
all strings returned in the appropriate columns are concatenated together,
separated by dashes \fI(\*(L"\-\*(R")\fR.
.IP "\fBInstancesFrom\fR \fIcolumn0\fR [\fIcolumn1\fR ...]" 4
.IX Item "InstancesFrom column0 [column1 ...]"
Specifies the columns whose values will be used to create the \*(L"type-instance\*(R"
for each row. If you specify more than one column, the value of all columns
will be joined together with dashes \fI(\*(L"\-\*(R")\fR as separation characters.
.Sp
The plugin itself does not check whether or not all built instances are
different. It's your responsibility to assure that each is unique. This is
especially true, if you do not specify \fBInstancesFrom\fR: \fBYou\fR have to make
sure that only one row is returned in this case.
.Sp
If neither \fBInstancePrefix\fR nor \fBInstancesFrom\fR is given, the type-instance
will be empty.
.IP "\fBValuesFrom\fR \fIcolumn0\fR [\fIcolumn1\fR ...]" 4
.IX Item "ValuesFrom column0 [column1 ...]"
Names the columns whose content is used as the actual data for the data sets
that are dispatched to the daemon. How many such columns you need is determined
by the \fBType\fR setting above. If you specify too many or not enough columns,
the plugin will complain about that and no data will be submitted to the
daemon.
.Sp
The actual data type in the columns is not that important. The plugin will
automatically cast the values to the right type if it know how to do that. So
it should be able to handle integer an floating point types, as well as strings
(if they include a number at the beginning).
.Sp
There must be at least one \fBValuesFrom\fR option inside each \fBResult\fR block.
.PP
\fI\f(BIDatabase\fI blocks\fR
.IX Subsection "Database blocks"
.PP
Database blocks define a connection to a database and which queries should be
sent to that database. Since the used \*(L"dbi\*(R" library can handle a wide variety
of databases, the configuration is very generic. If in doubt, refer to libdbi's
documentation\ \- we stick as close to the terminology used there.
.PP
Each database needs a \*(L"name\*(R" as string argument in the starting tag of the
block. This name will be used as \*(L"PluginInstance\*(R" in the values submitted to
the daemon. Other than that, that name is not used.
.IP "\fBDriver\fR \fIDriver\fR" 4
.IX Item "Driver Driver"
Specifies the driver to use to connect to the database. In many cases those
drivers are named after the database they can connect to, but this is not a
technical necessity. These drivers are sometimes referred to as \*(L"\s-1DBD\s0\*(R",
\&\fBD\fRata\fBB\fRase \fBD\fRriver, and some distributions ship them in separate
packages. Drivers for the \*(L"dbi\*(R" library are developed by the \fBlibdbi-drivers\fR
project at <http://libdbi\-drivers.sourceforge.net/>.
.Sp
You need to give the driver name as expected by the \*(L"dbi\*(R" library here. You
should be able to find that in the documentation for each driver. If you
mistype the driver name, the plugin will dump a list of all known driver names
to the log.
.IP "\fBDriverOption\fR \fIKey\fR \fIValue\fR" 4
.IX Item "DriverOption Key Value"
Sets driver-specific options. What option a driver supports can be found in the
documentation for each driver, somewhere at
<http://libdbi\-drivers.sourceforge.net/>. However, the options \*(L"host\*(R",
\&\*(L"username\*(R", \*(L"password\*(R", and \*(L"dbname\*(R" seem to be de\ facto standards.
.Sp
DBDs can register two types of options: String options and numeric options. The
plugin will use the \f(CW\*(C`dbi_conn_set_option\*(C'\fR function when the configuration
provides a string and the \f(CW\*(C`dbi_conn_require_option_numeric\*(C'\fR function when the
configuration provides a number. So these two lines will actually result in
different calls being used:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  DriverOption "Port" 1234      # numeric
\&  DriverOption "Port" "1234"    # string
.Ve
.Sp
Unfortunately, drivers are not too keen to report errors when an unknown option
is passed to them, so invalid settings here may go unnoticed. This is not the
plugin's fault, it will report errors if it gets them from the library\ /
the driver. If a driver complains about an option, the plugin will dump a
complete list of all options understood by that driver to the log. There is no
way to programatically find out if an option expects a string or a numeric
argument, so you will have to refer to the appropriate \s-1DBD\s0's documentation to
find this out. Sorry.
.IP "\fBSelectDB\fR \fIDatabase\fR" 4
.IX Item "SelectDB Database"
In some cases, the database name you connect with is not the database name you
want to use for querying data. If this option is set, the plugin will \*(L"select\*(R"
(switch to) that database after the connection is established.
.IP "\fBQuery\fR \fIQueryName\fR" 4
.IX Item "Query QueryName"
Associates the query named \fIQueryName\fR with this database connection. The
query needs to be defined \fIbefore\fR this statement, i.\ e. all query
blocks you want to refer to must be placed above the database block you want to
refer to them from.
.IP "\fBHost\fR \fIHostname\fR" 4
.IX Item "Host Hostname"
Sets the \fBhost\fR field of \fIvalue lists\fR to \fIHostname\fR when dispatching
values. Defaults to the global hostname setting.

at all, \fBall\fR partitions are selected.
.IP "\fBReportByDevice\fR \fBtrue\fR|\fBfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "ReportByDevice true|false"
Report using the device name rather than the mountpoint. i.e. with this \fIfalse\fR,
(the default), it will report a disk as \*(L"root\*(R", but with it \fItrue\fR, it will be
\&\*(L"sda1\*(R" (or whichever).
.IP "\fBReportInodes\fR \fBtrue\fR|\fBfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "ReportInodes true|false"
Enables or disables reporting of free, reserved and used inodes. Defaults to
inode collection being disabled.
.Sp
Enable this option if inodes are a scarce resource for you, usually because
many small files are stored on the disk. This is a usual scenario for mail
transfer agents and web caches.
.ie n .SS "Plugin ""disk"""
.el .SS "Plugin \f(CWdisk\fP"
.IX Subsection "Plugin disk"
The \f(CW\*(C`disk\*(C'\fR plugin collects information about the usage of physical disks and
logical disks (partitions). Values collected are the number of octets written
to and read from a disk or partition, the number of read/write operations
issued to the disk and a rather complex \*(L"time\*(R" it took for these commands to be
issued.
.PP
Using the following two options you can ignore some disks or configure the
collection only of specific disks.
.IP "\fBDisk\fR \fIName\fR" 4
.IX Item "Disk Name"
Select the disk \fIName\fR. Whether it is collected or ignored depends on the
\&\fBIgnoreSelected\fR setting, see below. As with other plugins that use the
daemon's ignorelist functionality, a string that starts and ends with a slash
is interpreted as a regular expression. Examples:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  Disk "sdd"
\&  Disk "/hda[34]/"
.Ve
.IP "\fBIgnoreSelected\fR \fBtrue\fR|\fBfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "IgnoreSelected true|false"
Sets whether selected disks, i.\ e. the ones matches by any of the \fBDisk\fR
statements, are ignored or if all other disks are ignored. The behavior
(hopefully) is intuitive: If no \fBDisk\fR option is configured, all disks are
collected. If at least one \fBDisk\fR option is given and no \fBIgnoreSelected\fR or
set to \fBfalse\fR, \fBonly\fR matching disks will be collected. If \fBIgnoreSelected\fR

.PD
Execute the executable \fIExecutable\fR as user \fIUser\fR. If the user name is
followed by a colon and a group name, the effective group is set to that group.
The real group and saved-set group will be set to the default group of that
user. If no group is given the effective group \s-1ID\s0 will be the same as the real
group \s-1ID\s0.
.Sp
Please note that in order to change the user and/or group the daemon needs
superuser privileges. If the daemon is run as an unprivileged user you must
specify the same user/group here. If the daemon is run with superuser
privileges, you must supply a non-root user here.
.Sp
The executable may be followed by optional arguments that are passed to the
program. Please note that due to the configuration parsing numbers and boolean
values may be changed. If you want to be absolutely sure that something is
passed as-is please enclose it in quotes.
.Sp
The \fBExec\fR and \fBNotificationExec\fR statements change the semantics of the

expected from them. This is documented in great detail in \fIcollectd\-exec\fR\|(5).
.ie n .SS "Plugin ""filecount"""
.el .SS "Plugin \f(CWfilecount\fP"
.IX Subsection "Plugin filecount"
The \f(CW\*(C`filecount\*(C'\fR plugin counts the number of files in a certain directory (and
its subdirectories) and their combined size. The configuration is very straight
forward:
.PP
.Vb 12
\&  <Plugin "filecount">
\&    <Directory "/var/qmail/queue/mess">
\&      Instance "qmail\-message"
\&    </Directory>
\&    <Directory "/var/qmail/queue/todo">
\&      Instance "qmail\-todo"
\&    </Directory>
\&    <Directory "/var/lib/php5">
\&      Instance "php5\-sessions"
\&      Name "sess_*"
\&    </Directory>
\&  </Plugin>
.Ve
.PP
The example above counts the number of files in QMail's queue directories and
the number of \s-1PHP5\s0 sessions. Jfiy: The \*(L"todo\*(R" queue holds the messages that
QMail has not yet looked at, the \*(L"message\*(R" queue holds the messages that were
classified into \*(L"local\*(R" and \*(L"remote\*(R".
.PP
As you can see, the configuration consists of one or more \f(CW\*(C`Directory\*(C'\fR blocks,
each of which specifies a directory in which to count the files. Within those
blocks, the following options are recognized:
.IP "\fBInstance\fR \fIInstance\fR" 4
.IX Item "Instance Instance"
Sets the plugin instance to \fIInstance\fR. That instance name must be unique, but
it's your responsibility, the plugin doesn't check for that. If not given, the
instance is set to the directory name with all slashes replaced by underscores
and all leading underscores removed.
.IP "\fBName\fR \fIPattern\fR" 4
.IX Item "Name Pattern"
Only count files that match \fIPattern\fR, where \fIPattern\fR is a shell-like
wildcard as understood by \fIfnmatch\fR\|(3). Only the \fBfilename\fR is checked
against the pattern, not the entire path. In case this makes it easier for you:
This option has been named after the \fB\-name\fR parameter to \fIfind\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fBMTime\fR \fIAge\fR" 4
.IX Item "MTime Age"
Count only files of a specific age: If \fIAge\fR is greater than zero, only files
that haven't been touched in the last \fIAge\fR seconds are counted. If \fIAge\fR is
a negative number, this is inversed. For example, if \fB\-60\fR is specified, only
files that have been modified in the last minute will be counted.
.Sp
The number can also be followed by a \*(L"multiplier\*(R" to easily specify a larger
timespan. When given in this notation, the argument must in quoted, i.\ e.
must be passed as string. So the \fB\-60\fR could also be written as \fB\*(L"\-1m\*(R"\fR (one
minute). Valid multipliers are \f(CW\*(C`s\*(C'\fR (second), \f(CW\*(C`m\*(C'\fR (minute), \f(CW\*(C`h\*(C'\fR (hour), \f(CW\*(C`d\*(C'\fR
(day), \f(CW\*(C`w\*(C'\fR (week), and \f(CW\*(C`y\*(C'\fR (year). There is no \*(L"month\*(R" multiplier. You can
also specify fractional numbers, e.\ g. \fB\*(L"0.5d\*(R"\fR is identical to
\&\fB\*(L"12h\*(R"\fR.
.IP "\fBSize\fR \fISize\fR" 4
.IX Item "Size Size"
Count only files of a specific size. When \fISize\fR is a positive number, only
files that are at least this big are counted. If \fISize\fR is a negative number,
this is inversed, i.\ e. only files smaller than the absolute value of
\&\fISize\fR are counted.
.Sp
As with the \fBMTime\fR option, a \*(L"multiplier\*(R" may be added. For a detailed
description see above. Valid multipliers here are \f(CW\*(C`b\*(C'\fR (byte), \f(CW\*(C`k\*(C'\fR (kilobyte),
\&\f(CW\*(C`m\*(C'\fR (megabyte), \f(CW\*(C`g\*(C'\fR (gigabyte), \f(CW\*(C`t\*(C'\fR (terabyte), and \f(CW\*(C`p\*(C'\fR (petabyte). Please
note that there are 1000 bytes in a kilobyte, not 1024.
.IP "\fBRecursive\fR \fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "Recursive true|false"
Controls whether or not to recurse into subdirectories. Enabled by default.
.IP "\fBIncludeHidden\fR \fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "IncludeHidden true|false"
Controls whether or not to include \*(L"hidden\*(R" files and directories in the count.
\&\*(L"Hidden\*(R" files and directories are those, whose name begins with a dot.
Defaults to \fIfalse\fR, i.e. by default hidden files and directories are ignored.

.IP "\fBLoadPlugin\fR \fIJavaClass\fR" 4
.IX Item "LoadPlugin JavaClass"
Instantiates a new \fIJavaClass\fR object. The constructor of this object very
likely then registers one or more callback methods with the server.
.Sp
See \fIcollectd\-java\fR\|(5) for details.
.Sp
When the first such option is found, the virtual machine (\s-1JVM\s0) is created. This

.IP "\fBPlugin\fR \fIName\fR" 4
.IX Item "Plugin Name"
The entire block is passed to the Java plugin as an
\&\fIorg.collectd.api.OConfigItem\fR object.
.Sp
For this to work, the plugin has to register a configuration callback first,
see \*(L"config callback\*(R" in \fIcollectd\-java\fR\|(5). This means, that the \fBPlugin\fR block
must appear after the appropriate \fBLoadPlugin\fR block. Also note, that \fIName\fR
depends on the (Java) plugin registering the callback and is completely
independent from the \fIJavaClass\fR argument passed to \fBLoadPlugin\fR.

When the libvirt plugin logs data, it sets the hostname of the collected data
according to this setting. The default is to use the guest name as provided by

\&\fBuuid\fR means use the guest's \s-1UUID\s0. This is useful if you want to track the
same guest across migrations.
.Sp
\&\fBhostname\fR means to use the global \fBHostname\fR setting, which is probably not
useful on its own because all guests will appear to have the same name.
.Sp
You can also specify combinations of these fields. For example \fBname uuid\fR
means to concatenate the guest name and \s-1UUID\s0 (with a literal colon character
between, thus \fI\*(L"foo:1234\-1234\-1234\-1234\*(R"\fR).

.PD
Instruct the plugin to collect interface statistics. This is basically the same
as the statistics provided by the \f(CW\*(C`interface\*(C'\fR plugin (see above) but
potentially much more detailed.
.Sp
When configuring with \fBInterface\fR only the basic statistics will be collected,
namely octets, packets, and errors. These statistics are collected by
the \f(CW\*(C`interface\*(C'\fR plugin, too, so using both at the same time is no benefit.
.Sp
When configured with \fBVerboseInterface\fR all counters \fBexcept\fR the basic ones,
so that no data needs to be collected twice if you use the \f(CW\*(C`interface\*(C'\fR plugin.
This includes dropped packets, received multicast packets, collisions and a
whole zoo of differentiated \s-1RX\s0 and \s-1TX\s0 errors. You can try the following command
to get an idea of what awaits you:
.Sp
.Vb 1

.IX Item "Filter Interface [Filter]"
.PD
Collect the octets and packets that pass a certain qdisc, class or filter.
.Sp
QDiscs and classes are identified by their type and handle (or classid).
Filters don't necessarily have a handle, therefore the parent's handle is used.
The notation used in collectd differs from that used in \fItc\fR\|(1) in that it
doesn't skip the major or minor number if it's zero and doesn't print special
ids by their name. So, for example, a qdisc may be identified by
\&\f(CW\*(C`pfifo_fast\-1:0\*(C'\fR even though the minor number of \fBall\fR qdiscs is zero and
thus not displayed by \fItc\fR\|(1).
.Sp
If \fBQDisc\fR, \fBClass\fR, or \fBFilter\fR is given without the second argument,
i.\ .e. without an identifier, all qdiscs, classes, or filters that are
associated with that interface will be collected.
.Sp
Since a filter itself doesn't necessarily have a handle, the parent's handle is
used. This may lead to problems when more than one filter is attached to a
qdisc or class. This isn't nice, but we don't know how this could be done any
better. If you have a idea, please don't hesitate to tell us.
.Sp
As with the \fBInterface\fR option you can specify \fBAll\fR as the interface,
meaning all interfaces.

Here are some examples to help you understand the above text more easily:

This feature is only available if the \fInetwork\fR plugin was linked with
\&\fIlibgcrypt\fR.
.IP "\fBAuthFile\fR \fIFilename\fR" 4
.IX Item "AuthFile Filename"
Sets a file in which usernames are mapped to passwords. These passwords are
used to verify signatures and to decrypt encrypted network packets. If
\&\fBSecurityLevel\fR is set to \fBNone\fR, this is optional. If given, signed data is
verified and encrypted packets are decrypted. Otherwise, signed data is
accepted without checking the signature and encrypted data cannot be decrypted.
For the other security levels this option is mandatory.
.Sp
The file format is very simple: Each line consists of a username followed by a
colon and any number of spaces followed by the password. To demonstrate, an
example file could look like this:
.Sp
.Vb 2

.IX Item "Interface Interface name"
Set the incoming interface for \s-1IP\s0 packets explicitly. This applies at least
to IPv6 packets and if possible to IPv4. If this option is not applicable,
undefined or a non-existent interface name is specified, the default

.Sp
On the server side, this limit should be set to the largest value used on

.IP "\fBForward\fR \fItrue|false\fR" 4
.IX Item "Forward true|false"
If set to \fItrue\fR, write packets that were received via the network plugin to
the sending sockets. This should only be activated when the \fBListen\fR\- and

the same multicast group. While this results in more network traffic than
necessary it's not a huge problem since the plugin has a duplicate detection,
so the values will not loop.

The \f(CW\*(C`postgresql\*(C'\fR plugin queries statistics from PostgreSQL databases. It
keeps a persistent connection to all configured databases and tries to
reconnect if the connection has been interrupted. A database is configured by
specifying a \fBDatabase\fR block as described below. The default statistics are

enabled for this plugin to work correctly. This should usually be the case by
default. See the section \*(L"The Statistics Collector\*(R" of the \fBPostgreSQL

By specifying custom database queries using a \fBQuery\fR block as described
below, you may collect any data that is available from some PostgreSQL
database. This way, you are able to access statistics of external daemons
which are available in a PostgreSQL database or use future or special
statistics provided by PostgreSQL without the need to upgrade your collectd
installation.
.PP
Starting with version 5.2, the \f(CW\*(C`postgresql\*(C'\fR plugin supports writing data to
PostgreSQL databases as well. This has been implemented in a generic way. You
need to specify an \s-1SQL\s0 statement which will then be executed by collectd in
order to write the data (see below for details). The benefit of that approach
is that there is no fixed database layout. Rather, the layout may be optimized
for the current setup.

it represents numbers. The plugin will automatically cast the values to the
right type if it know how to do that. For that, it uses the \fIstrtoll\fR\|(3) and
\&\fIstrtod\fR\|(3) functions, so anything supported by those functions is supported
by the plugin as well.

The \fBDatabase\fR block defines one PostgreSQL database for which to collect
statistics. It accepts a single mandatory argument which specifies the
database name. None of the other options are required. PostgreSQL will use
default values as documented in the section \*(L"\s-1CONNECTING\s0 \s-1TO\s0 A \s-1DATABASE\s0\*(R" in the

Specify the interval with which the database should be queried. The default is

.IP "\fBCommitInterval\fR \fIseconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "CommitInterval seconds"
This option may be used for database connections which have \*(L"writers\*(R" assigned
(see above). If specified, it causes a writer to put several updates into a
single transaction. This transaction will last for the specified amount of
time. By default, each update will be executed in a separate transaction. Each
transaction generates a fair amount of overhead which can, thus, be reduced by
activating this option. The draw-back is, that data covering the specified
amount of time will be lost, for example, if a single statement within the
transaction fails or if the database server crashes.
.IP "\fBHost\fR \fIhostname\fR" 4
.IX Item "Host hostname"
Specify the hostname or \s-1IP\s0 of the PostgreSQL server to connect to. If the
value begins with a slash, it is interpreted as the directory name in which to
look for the \s-1UNIX\s0 domain socket.
.Sp
This option is also used to determine the hostname that is associated with a
collected data set. If it has been omitted or either begins with with a slash

The method of getting the values differs for \fBServer\fR and \fBRecursor\fR blocks:
When querying the server a \f(CW\*(C`SHOW *\*(C'\fR command is issued in any case, because

collectd then picks out the values you have selected. When querying the

to store values to \s-1RRD\s0 files in an efficient manner. The combination of the
\&\f(CW\*(C`rrdcached\*(C'\fR \fBplugin\fR and the \f(CW\*(C`rrdcached\*(C'\fR \fBdaemon\fR is very similar to the
way the \f(CW\*(C`rrdtool\*(C'\fR plugin works (see below). The added abstraction layer
provides a number of benefits, though: Because the cache is not within
\&\f(CW\*(C`collectd\*(C'\fR anymore, it does not need to be flushed when \f(CW\*(C`collectd\*(C'\fR is to be
restarted. This results in much shorter (if any) gaps in graphs, especially
under heavy load. Also, the \f(CW\*(C`rrdtool\*(C'\fR command line utility is aware of the
daemon so that it can flush values to disk automatically when needed. This
allows to integrate automated flushing of values into graphing solutions much
more easily.
.PP
There are disadvantages, though: The daemon may reside on a different host, so
it may not be possible for \f(CW\*(C`collectd\*(C'\fR to create the appropriate \s-1RRD\s0 files
anymore. And even if \f(CW\*(C`rrdcached\*(C'\fR runs on the same host, it may run in a
different base directory, so relative paths may do weird stuff if you're not
careful.
.PP
So the \fBrecommended configuration\fR is to let \f(CW\*(C`collectd\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`rrdcached\*(C'\fR run
on the same host, communicating via a \s-1UNIX\s0 domain socket. The \fBDataDir\fR
setting should be set to an absolute path, so that a changed base directory
does not result in \s-1RRD\s0 files being created\ / expected in the wrong place.
.IP "\fBDaemonAddress\fR \fIAddress\fR" 4
.IX Item "DaemonAddress Address"
Address of the daemon as understood by the \f(CW\*(C`rrdc_connect\*(C'\fR function of the \s-1RRD\s0
library. See \fIrrdcached\fR\|(1) for details. Example:
.Sp
.Vb 3

\&    DaemonAddress "unix:/var/run/rrdcached.sock"
\&  </Plugin>
.Ve
.IP "\fBDataDir\fR \fIDirectory\fR" 4
.IX Item "DataDir Directory"
Set the base directory in which the \s-1RRD\s0 files reside. If this is a relative
path, it is relative to the working base directory of the \f(CW\*(C`rrdcached\*(C'\fR daemon!
Use of an absolute path is recommended.
.IP "\fBCreateFiles\fR \fBtrue\fR|\fBfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "CreateFiles true|false"
Enables or disables the creation of \s-1RRD\s0 files. If the daemon is not running
locally, or \fBDataDir\fR is set to a relative path, this will not work as
expected. Default is \fBtrue\fR.
.IP "\fBCreateFilesAsync\fR \fBfalse\fR|\fBtrue\fR" 4
.IX Item "CreateFilesAsync false|true"
When enabled, new \s-1RRD\s0 files are enabled asynchronously, using a separate thread
that runs in the background. This prevents writes to block, which is a problem
especially when many hundreds of files need to be created at once. However,
since the purpose of creating the files asynchronously is \fInot\fR to block until
the file is available, values before the file is available will be discarded.
When disabled (the default) files are created synchronously, blocking for a
short while, while the file is being written.
.IP "\fBStepSize\fR \fISeconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "StepSize Seconds"
\&\fBForce\fR the stepsize of newly created RRD-files. Ideally (and per default)
this setting is unset and the stepsize is set to the interval in which the data
is collected. Do not use this option unless you absolutely have to for some
reason. Setting this option may cause problems with the \f(CW\*(C`snmp plugin\*(C'\fR, the
\&\f(CW\*(C`exec plugin\*(C'\fR or when the daemon is set up to receive data from other hosts.
.IP "\fBHeartBeat\fR \fISeconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "HeartBeat Seconds"
\&\fBForce\fR the heartbeat of newly created RRD-files. This setting should be unset
in which case the heartbeat is set to twice the \fBStepSize\fR which should equal
the interval in which data is collected. Do not set this option unless you have
a very good reason to do so.
.IP "\fBRRARows\fR \fINumRows\fR" 4
.IX Item "RRARows NumRows"
The \f(CW\*(C`rrdtool plugin\*(C'\fR calculates the number of PDPs per \s-1CDP\s0 based on the
\&\fBStepSize\fR, this setting and a timespan. This plugin creates RRD-files with
three times five RRAs, i. e. five RRAs with the CFs \fB\s-1MIN\s0\fR, \fB\s-1AVERAGE\s0\fR, and
\&\fB\s-1MAX\s0\fR. The five RRAs are optimized for graphs covering one hour, one day, one
week, one month, and one year.
.Sp
So for each timespan, it calculates how many PDPs need to be consolidated into
one \s-1CDP\s0 by calculating:
  number of PDPs = timespan / (stepsize * rrarows)
.Sp
Bottom line is, set this no smaller than the width of you graphs in pixels. The
default is 1200.
.IP "\fBRRATimespan\fR \fISeconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "RRATimespan Seconds"
Adds an RRA-timespan, given in seconds. Use this option multiple times to have
more then one \s-1RRA\s0. If this option is never used, the built-in default of (3600,
86400, 604800, 2678400, 31622400) is used.
.Sp

one (exclusive).
.IP "\fBCacheFlush\fR \fISeconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "CacheFlush Seconds"
When the \f(CW\*(C`rrdtool\*(C'\fR plugin uses a cache (by setting \fBCacheTimeout\fR, see below)
it writes all values for a certain RRD-file if the oldest value is older than
(or equal to) the number of seconds specified. If some RRD-file is not updated
anymore for some reason (the computer was shut down, the network is broken,
etc.) some values may still be in the cache. If \fBCacheFlush\fR is set, then the
entire cache is searched for entries older than \fBCacheTimeout\fR seconds and
written to disk every \fISeconds\fR seconds. Since this is kind of expensive and
does nothing under normal circumstances, this value should not be too small.
900 seconds might be a good value, though setting this to 7200 seconds doesn't
normally do much harm either.
.IP "\fBCacheTimeout\fR \fISeconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "CacheTimeout Seconds"
If this option is set to a value greater than zero, the \f(CW\*(C`rrdtool plugin\*(C'\fR will
save values in a cache, as described above. Writing multiple values at once
reduces IO-operations and thus lessens the load produced by updating the files.
The trade off is that the graphs kind of \*(L"drag behind\*(R" and that more memory is
used.
.IP "\fBWritesPerSecond\fR \fIUpdates\fR" 4
.IX Item "WritesPerSecond Updates"
When collecting many statistics with collectd and the \f(CW\*(C`rrdtool\*(C'\fR plugin, you
will run serious performance problems. The \fBCacheFlush\fR setting and the
internal update queue assert that collectd continues to work just fine even
under heavy load, but the system may become very unresponsive and slow. This is
a problem especially if you create graphs from the \s-1RRD\s0 files on the same
machine, for example using the \f(CW\*(C`graph.cgi\*(C'\fR script included in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`contrib/collection3/\*(C'\fR directory.
.Sp
This setting is designed for very large setups. Setting this option to a value
between 25 and 80 updates per second, depending on your hardware, will leave
the server responsive enough to draw graphs even while all the cached values
are written to disk. Flushed values, i.\ e. values that are forced to disk
by the \fB\s-1FLUSH\s0\fR command, are \fBnot\fR effected by this limit. They are still
written as fast as possible, so that web frontends have up to date data when
generating graphs.
.Sp
For example: If you have 100,000 \s-1RRD\s0 files and set \fBWritesPerSecond\fR to 30
updates per second, writing all values to disk will take approximately
56\ minutes. Together with the flushing ability that's integrated into
\&\*(L"collection3\*(R" you'll end up with a responsive and fast system, up to date
graphs and basically a \*(L"backup\*(R" of your values every hour.
.IP "\fBRandomTimeout\fR \fISeconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "RandomTimeout Seconds"
When set, the actual timeout for each value is chosen randomly between
\&\fICacheTimeout\fR\-\fIRandomTimeout\fR and \fICacheTimeout\fR+\fIRandomTimeout\fR. The
intention is to avoid high load situations that appear when many values timeout
at the same time. This is especially a problem shortly after the daemon starts,
because all values were added to the internal cache at roughly the same time.
.ie n .SS "Plugin ""sensors"""
.el .SS "Plugin \f(CWsensors\fP"
.IX Subsection "Plugin sensors"
The \fISensors plugin\fR uses \fBlm_sensors\fR to retrieve sensor-values. This means
that all the needed modules have to be loaded and lm_sensors has to be
configured (most likely by editing \fI/etc/sensors.conf\fR. Read
\&\fIsensors.conf\fR\|(5) for details.
.PP
The \fBlm_sensors\fR homepage can be found at
<http://secure.netroedge.com/~lm78/>.
.IP "\fBSensorConfigFile\fR \fIFile\fR" 4
.IX Item "SensorConfigFile File"
Read the \fIlm_sensors\fR configuration from \fIFile\fR. When unset (recommended),
the library's default will be used.
.IP "\fBSensor\fR \fIchip\-bus\-address/type\-feature\fR" 4
.IX Item "Sensor chip-bus-address/type-feature"
Selects the name of the sensor which you want to collect or ignore, depending
on the \fBIgnoreSelected\fR below. For example, the option "\fBSensor\fR
\&\fIit8712\-isa\-0290/voltage\-in1\fR" will cause collectd to gather data for the
voltage sensor \fIin1\fR of the \fIit8712\fR on the isa bus at the address 0290.
.IP "\fBIgnoreSelected\fR \fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "IgnoreSelected true|false"
If no configuration if given, the \fBsensors\fR\-plugin will collect data from all
sensors. This may not be practical, especially for uninteresting sensors.
Thus, you can use the \fBSensor\fR\-option to pick the sensors you're interested
in. Sometimes, however, it's easier/preferred to collect all sensors \fIexcept\fR a
few ones. This option enables you to do that: By setting \fBIgnoreSelected\fR to
\&\fItrue\fR the effect of \fBSensor\fR is inverted: All selected sensors are ignored
and all other sensors are collected.

.IX Item "NotifyLevel OKAY|WARNING|FAILURE"
Controls which notifications should be sent to syslog. The default behaviour is
not to send any. Less severe notifications always imply logging more severe
notifications: Setting this to \fB\s-1OKAY\s0\fR means all notifications will be sent to
syslog, setting this to \fB\s-1WARNING\s0\fR will send \fB\s-1WARNING\s0\fR and \fB\s-1FAILURE\s0\fR
notifications but will dismiss \fB\s-1OKAY\s0\fR notifications. Setting this option to

Any character of \fIstring\fR is interpreted as a delimiter between the different

Specifies the columns (identified by the column numbers starting at zero)
whose content is used as the actual data for the data sets that are dispatched
to the daemon. How many such columns you need is determined by the \fBType\fR

The following options are understood by the \fIwrite_riemann plugin\fR:
.IP "<\fBNode\fR \fIName\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<Node Name>"
The plugin's configuration consists of one or more \fBNode\fR blocks. Each block
is given a unique \fIName\fR and specifies one connection to an instance of
\&\fIRiemann\fR. Indise the \fBNode\fR block, the following per-connection options are
understood:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBHost\fR \fIAddress\fR" 4

.SH "THRESHOLD CONFIGURATION"
.IX Header "THRESHOLD CONFIGURATION"
Starting with version \f(CW4.3.0\fR collectd has support for \fBmonitoring\fR. By that
we mean that the values are not only stored or sent somewhere, but that they
are judged and, if a problem is recognized, acted upon. The only action
collectd takes itself is to generate and dispatch a \*(L"notification\*(R". Plugins can
register to receive notifications and perform appropriate further actions.
.PP
Since systems and what you expect them to do differ a lot, you can configure
\&\fBthresholds\fR for your values freely. This gives you a lot of flexibility but
also a lot of responsibility.
.PP
Every time a value is out of range a notification is dispatched. This means
that the idle percentage of your \s-1CPU\s0 needs to be less then the configured
threshold only once for a notification to be generated. There's no such thing
as a moving average or similar \- at least not now.
.PP
Also, all values that match a threshold are considered to be relevant or
\&\*(L"interesting\*(R". As a consequence collectd will issue a notification if they are
not received for \fBTimeout\fR iterations. The \fBTimeout\fR configuration option is
explained in section \*(L"\s-1GLOBAL\s0 \s-1OPTIONS\s0\*(R". If, for example, \fBTimeout\fR is set to
\&\*(L"2\*(R" (the default) and some hosts sends it's \s-1CPU\s0 statistics to the server every
60 seconds, a notification will be dispatched after about 120 seconds. It may
take a little longer because the timeout is checked only once each \fBInterval\fR
on the server.
.PP
When a value comes within range again or is received after it was missing, an
\&\*(L"OKAY-notification\*(R" is dispatched.
.PP
Here is a configuration example to get you started. Read below for more
information.

.PP
There are basically two types of configuration statements: The \f(CW\*(C`Host\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`Plugin\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`Type\*(C'\fR blocks select the value for which a threshold should be
configured. The \f(CW\*(C`Plugin\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`Type\*(C'\fR blocks may be specified further using the
\&\f(CW\*(C`Instance\*(C'\fR option. You can combine the block by nesting the blocks, though
they must be nested in the above order, i.\ e. \f(CW\*(C`Host\*(C'\fR may contain either
\&\f(CW\*(C`Plugin\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`Type\*(C'\fR blocks, \f(CW\*(C`Plugin\*(C'\fR may only contain \f(CW\*(C`Type\*(C'\fR blocks and
\&\f(CW\*(C`Type\*(C'\fR may not contain other blocks. If multiple blocks apply to the same
value the most specific block is used.
.PP
The other statements specify the threshold to configure. They \fBmust\fR be
included in a \f(CW\*(C`Type\*(C'\fR block. Currently the following statements are recognized:
.IP "\fBFailureMax\fR \fIValue\fR" 4
.IX Item "FailureMax Value"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBWarningMax\fR \fIValue\fR" 4
.IX Item "WarningMax Value"
.PD
Sets the upper bound of acceptable values. If unset defaults to positive
infinity. If a value is greater than \fBFailureMax\fR a \fB\s-1FAILURE\s0\fR notification
will be created. If the value is greater than \fBWarningMax\fR but less than (or
equal to) \fBFailureMax\fR a \fB\s-1WARNING\s0\fR notification will be created.
.IP "\fBFailureMin\fR \fIValue\fR" 4
.IX Item "FailureMin Value"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBWarningMin\fR \fIValue\fR" 4
.IX Item "WarningMin Value"
.PD
Sets the lower bound of acceptable values. If unset defaults to negative
infinity. If a value is less than \fBFailureMin\fR a \fB\s-1FAILURE\s0\fR notification will
be created. If the value is less than \fBWarningMin\fR but greater than (or equal
to) \fBFailureMin\fR a \fB\s-1WARNING\s0\fR notification will be created.
.IP "\fBDataSource\fR \fIDSName\fR" 4
.IX Item "DataSource DSName"
Some data sets have more than one \*(L"data source\*(R". Interesting examples are the
\&\f(CW\*(C`if_octets\*(C'\fR data set, which has received (\f(CW\*(C`rx\*(C'\fR) and sent (\f(CW\*(C`tx\*(C'\fR) bytes and
the \f(CW\*(C`disk_ops\*(C'\fR data set, which holds \f(CW\*(C`read\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`write\*(C'\fR operations. The
system load data set, \f(CW\*(C`load\*(C'\fR, even has three data sources: \f(CW\*(C`shortterm\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`midterm\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`longterm\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Normally, all data sources are checked against a configured threshold. If this
is undesirable, or if you want to specify different limits for each data
source, you can use the \fBDataSource\fR option to have a threshold apply only to
one data source.
.IP "\fBInvert\fR \fBtrue\fR|\fBfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "Invert true|false"
If set to \fBtrue\fR the range of acceptable values is inverted, i.\ e.
values between \fBFailureMin\fR and \fBFailureMax\fR (\fBWarningMin\fR and
\&\fBWarningMax\fR) are not okay. Defaults to \fBfalse\fR.
.IP "\fBPersist\fR \fBtrue\fR|\fBfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "Persist true|false"
Sets how often notifications are generated. If set to \fBtrue\fR one notification
will be generated for each value that is out of the acceptable range. If set to
\&\fBfalse\fR (the default) then a notification is only generated if a value is out
of range but the previous value was okay.
.Sp
This applies to missing values, too: If set to \fBtrue\fR a notification about a
missing value is generated once every \fBInterval\fR seconds. If set to \fBfalse\fR
only one such notification is generated until the value appears again.
.IP "\fBPercentage\fR \fBtrue\fR|\fBfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "Percentage true|false"
If set to \fBtrue\fR, the minimum and maximum values given are interpreted as
percentage value, relative to the other data sources. This is helpful for
example for the \*(L"df\*(R" type, where you may want to issue a warning when less than
5\ % of the total space is available. Defaults to \fBfalse\fR.
.IP "\fBHits\fR \fINumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "Hits Number"
Delay creating the notification until the threshold has been passed \fINumber\fR
times. When a notification has been generated, or when a subsequent value is
inside the threshold, the counter is reset. If, for example, a value is
collected once every 10\ seconds and \fBHits\fR is set to 3, a notification
will be dispatched at most once every 30\ seconds.
.Sp
This is useful when short bursts are not a problem. If, for example, 100% \s-1CPU\s0
usage for up to a minute is normal (and data is collected every
10\ seconds), you could set \fBHits\fR to \fB6\fR to account for this.
.IP "\fBHysteresis\fR \fINumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "Hysteresis Number"
When set to non-zero, a hysteresis value is applied when checking minimum and
maximum bounds. This is useful for values that increase slowly and fluctuate a
bit while doing so. When these values come close to the threshold, they may
\&\*(L"flap\*(R", i.e. switch between failure / warning case and okay case repeatedly.
.Sp
If, for example, the threshold is configures as
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  WarningMax 100.0
\&  Hysteresis 1.0
.Ve
.Sp
then a \fIWarning\fR notification is created when the value exceeds \fI101\fR and the
corresponding \fIOkay\fR notification is only created once the value falls below
\&\fI99\fR, thus avoiding the \*(L"flapping\*(R".
.SH "FILTER CONFIGURATION"
.IX Header "FILTER CONFIGURATION"
Starting with collectd 4.6 there is a powerful filtering infrastructure
implemented in the daemon. The concept has mostly been copied from
\&\fIip_tables\fR, the packet filter infrastructure for Linux. We'll use a similar
terminology, so that users that are familiar with iptables feel right at home.
.SS "Terminology"
.IX Subsection "Terminology"
The following are the terms used in the remainder of the filter configuration
documentation. For an ASCII-art schema of the mechanism, see
\&\*(L"General structure\*(R" below.
.IP "\fBMatch\fR" 4
.IX Item "Match"
A \fImatch\fR is a criteria to select specific values. Examples are, of course, the
name of the value or it's current value.
.Sp
Matches are implemented in plugins which you have to load prior to using the
match. The name of such plugins starts with the \*(L"match_\*(R" prefix.
.IP "\fBTarget\fR" 4
.IX Item "Target"
A \fItarget\fR is some action that is to be performed with data. Such actions
could, for example, be to change part of the value's identifier or to ignore
the value completely.
.Sp
Some of these targets are built into the daemon, see \*(L"Built-in targets\*(R"
below. Other targets are implemented in plugins which you have to load prior to
using the target. The name of such plugins starts with the \*(L"target_\*(R" prefix.
.IP "\fBRule\fR" 4
.IX Item "Rule"
The combination of any number of matches and at least one target is called a
\&\fIrule\fR. The target actions will be performed for all values for which \fBall\fR
matches apply. If the rule does not have any matches associated with it, the
target action will be performed for all values.
.IP "\fBChain\fR" 4
.IX Item "Chain"
A \fIchain\fR is a list of rules and possibly default targets. The rules are tried
in order and if one matches, the associated target will be called. If a value
is handled by a rule, it depends on the target whether or not any subsequent
rules are considered or if traversal of the chain is aborted, see
\&\*(L"Flow control\*(R" below. After all rules have been checked, the default targets
will be executed.

.SS "Flow control"
.IX Subsection "Flow control"
There are four ways to control which way a value takes through the filter
mechanism:
.IP "\fBjump\fR" 4
.IX Item "jump"
The built-in \fBjump\fR target can be used to \*(L"call\*(R" another chain, i.\ e.
process the value with another chain. When the called chain finishes, usually
the next target or rule after the jump is executed.
.IP "\fBstop\fR" 4
.IX Item "stop"
The stop condition, signaled for example by the built-in target \fBstop\fR, causes
all processing of the value to be stopped immediately.
.IP "\fBreturn\fR" 4
.IX Item "return"
Causes processing in the current chain to be aborted, but processing of the
value generally will continue. This means that if the chain was called via
\&\fBJump\fR, the next target or rule after the jump will be executed. If the chain
was not called by another chain, control will be returned to the daemon and it
may pass the value to another chain.
.IP "\fBcontinue\fR" 4
.IX Item "continue"
Most targets will signal the \fBcontinue\fR condition, meaning that processing
should continue normally. There is no special built-in target for this
condition.
.SS "Synopsis"
.IX Subsection "Synopsis"
The configuration reflects this structure directly:
.PP
.Vb 10
\& PostCacheChain "PostCache"
\& <Chain "PostCache">

.Ve
.PP
The above configuration example will ignore all values where the plugin field
is \*(L"mysql\*(R", the type is \*(L"mysql_command\*(R" and the type instance begins with
\&\*(L"show_\*(R". All other values will be sent to the \f(CW\*(C`rrdtool\*(C'\fR write plugin via the
default target of the chain. Since this chain is run after the value has been
added to the cache, the MySQL \f(CW\*(C`show_*\*(C'\fR command statistics will be available
via the \f(CW\*(C`unixsock\*(C'\fR plugin.
.SS "List of configuration options"

.Ve
.Sp
After the values are passed from the \*(L"read\*(R" plugins to the dispatch functions,
the pre-cache chain is run first. The values are added to the internal cache
afterwards. The post-cache chain is run after the values have been added to the
cache. So why is it such a huge deal if chains are run before or after the
values have been added to this cache?
.Sp
Targets that change the identifier of a value list should be executed before
the values are added to the cache, so that the name in the cache matches the
name that is used in the \*(L"write\*(R" plugins. The \f(CW\*(C`unixsock\*(C'\fR plugin, too, uses
this cache to receive a list of all available values. If you change the
identifier after the value list has been added to the cache, this may easily
lead to confusion, but it's not forbidden of course.
.Sp
The cache is also used to convert counter values to rates. These rates are, for
example, used by the \f(CW\*(C`value\*(C'\fR match (see below). If you use the rate stored in
the cache \fBbefore\fR the new value is added, you will use the old, \fBprevious\fR
rate. Write plugins may use this rate, too, see the \f(CW\*(C`csv\*(C'\fR plugin, for example.
The \f(CW\*(C`unixsock\*(C'\fR plugin uses these rates too, to implement the \f(CW\*(C`GETVAL\*(C'\fR
command.
.Sp
Last but not last, the \fBstop\fR target makes a difference: If the pre-cache
chain returns the stop condition, the value will not be added to the cache and
the post-cache chain will not be run.
.IP "\fBChain\fR \fIName\fR" 4
.IX Item "Chain Name"
Adds a new chain with a certain name. This name can be used to refer to a
specific chain, for example to jump to it.
.Sp
Within the \fBChain\fR block, there can be \fBRule\fR blocks and \fBTarget\fR blocks.
.IP "\fBRule\fR [\fIName\fR]" 4
.IX Item "Rule [Name]"
Adds a new rule to the current chain. The name of the rule is optional and
currently has no meaning for the daemon.
.Sp
Within the \fBRule\fR block, there may be any number of \fBMatch\fR blocks and there
must be at least one \fBTarget\fR block.
.IP "\fBMatch\fR \fIName\fR" 4
.IX Item "Match Name"
Adds a match to a \fBRule\fR block. The name specifies what kind of match should
be performed. Available matches depend on the plugins that have been loaded.
.Sp
The arguments inside the \fBMatch\fR block are passed to the plugin implementing
the match, so which arguments are valid here depends on the plugin being used.
If you do not need any to pass any arguments to a match, you can use the
shorter syntax:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& Match "foobar"

Which is equivalent to:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\& <Match "foobar">

.Ve
.IP "\fBTarget\fR \fIName\fR" 4
.IX Item "Target Name"
Add a target to a rule or a default target to a chain. The name specifies what
kind of target is to be added. Which targets are available depends on the
plugins being loaded.
.Sp
The arguments inside the \fBTarget\fR block are passed to the plugin implementing
the target, so which arguments are valid here depends on the plugin being used.
If you do not need any to pass any arguments to a target, you can use the
shorter syntax:

.SS "Built-in targets"
.IX Subsection "Built-in targets"
The following targets are built into the core daemon and therefore need no
plugins to be loaded:
.IP "\fBreturn\fR" 4
.IX Item "return"
Signals the \*(L"return\*(R" condition, see the \*(L"Flow control\*(R" section above. This
causes the current chain to stop processing the value and returns control to
the calling chain. The calling chain will continue processing targets and rules
just after the \fBjump\fR target (see below). This is very similar to the
\&\fB\s-1RETURN\s0\fR target of iptables, see \fIiptables\fR\|(8).
.Sp
This target does not have any options.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& Target "return"
.Ve
.IP "\fBstop\fR" 4
.IX Item "stop"
Signals the \*(L"stop\*(R" condition, see the \*(L"Flow control\*(R" section above. This
causes processing of the value to be aborted immediately. This is similar to
the \fB\s-1DROP\s0\fR target of iptables, see \fIiptables\fR\|(8).

Match values where the given regular expressions match the various fields of
the identifier of a value. If multiple regular expressions are given, \fBall\fR
regexen must match for a value to match.

.IP "\fBtimediff\fR" 4
.IX Item "timediff"
Matches values that have a time which differs from the time on the server.
.Sp
This match is mainly intended for servers that receive values over the
\&\f(CW\*(C`network\*(C'\fR plugin and write them to disk using the \f(CW\*(C`rrdtool\*(C'\fR plugin. RRDtool
is very sensitive to the timestamp used when updating the \s-1RRD\s0 files. In
particular, the time must be ever increasing. If a misbehaving client sends one
packet with a timestamp far in the future, all further packets with a correct
time will be ignored because of that one packet. What's worse, such corrupted
\&\s-1RRD\s0 files are hard to fix.
.Sp
This match lets one match all values \fBoutside\fR a specified time range
(relative to the server's time), so you can use the \fBstop\fR target (see below)
to ignore the value, for example.

.IP "\fBvalue\fR" 4
.IX Item "value"
Matches the actual value of data sources against given minimum\ / maximum
values. If a data-set consists of more than one data-source, all data-sources
must match the specified ranges for a positive match.
.Sp
Available options:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBMin\fR \fIValue\fR" 4
.IX Item "Min Value"
Sets the smallest value which still results in a match. If unset, behaves like
negative infinity.
.IP "\fBMax\fR \fIValue\fR" 4
.IX Item "Max Value"
Sets the largest value which still results in a match. If unset, behaves like
positive infinity.
.IP "\fBInvert\fR \fBtrue\fR|\fBfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "Invert true|false"
Inverts the selection. If the \fBMin\fR and \fBMax\fR settings result in a match,
no-match is returned and vice versa. Please note that the \fBInvert\fR setting
only effects how \fBMin\fR and \fBMax\fR are applied to a specific value. Especially
the \fBDataSource\fR and \fBSatisfy\fR settings (see below) are not inverted.
.IP "\fBDataSource\fR \fIDSName\fR [\fIDSName\fR ...]" 4
.IX Item "DataSource DSName [DSName ...]"
Select one or more of the data sources. If no data source is configured, all
data sources will be checked. If the type handled by the match does not have a
data source of the specified name(s), this will always result in no match
(independent of the \fBInvert\fR setting).
.IP "\fBSatisfy\fR \fBAny\fR|\fBAll\fR" 4
.IX Item "Satisfy Any|All"
Specifies how checking with several data sources is performed. If set to
\&\fBAny\fR, the match succeeds if one of the data sources is in the configured
range. If set to \fBAll\fR the match only succeeds if all data sources are within
the configured range. Default is \fBAll\fR.
.Sp
Usually \fBAll\fR is used for positive matches, \fBAny\fR is used for negative
matches. This means that with \fBAll\fR you usually check that all values are in a
\&\*(L"good\*(R" range, while with \fBAny\fR you check if any value is within a \*(L"bad\*(R" range
(or outside the \*(L"good\*(R" range).

.IP "\fBempty_counter\fR" 4
.IX Item "empty_counter"
Matches all values with one or more data sources of type \fB\s-1COUNTER\s0\fR and where
all counter values are zero. These counters usually \fInever\fR increased since
they started existing (and are therefore uninteresting), or got reset recently
or overflowed and you had really, \fIreally\fR bad luck.
.Sp
Please keep in mind that ignoring such counters can result in confusing
behavior: Counters which hardly ever increase will be zero for long periods of
time. If the counter is reset for some reason (machine or service restarted,
usually), the graph will be empty (\s-1NAN\s0) for a long time. People may not
understand why.
.IP "\fBhashed\fR" 4
.IX Item "hashed"
Calculates a hash value of the host name and matches values according to that
hash value. This makes it possible to divide all hosts into groups and match
only values that are in a specific group. The intended use is in load
balancing, where you want to handle only part of all data and leave the rest
for other servers.
.Sp
The hashing function used tries to distribute the hosts evenly. First, it
calculates a 32\ bit hash value using the characters of the hostname:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  hash_value = 0;
\&  for (i = 0; host[i] != 0; i++)
\&    hash_value = (hash_value * 251) + host[i];
.Ve
.Sp
The constant 251 is a prime number which is supposed to make this hash value
more random. The code then checks the group for this host according to the
\&\fITotal\fR and \fIMatch\fR arguments:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&  if ((hash_value % Total) == Match)
\&    matches;
\&  else
\&    does not match;
.Ve
.Sp
Please note that when you set \fITotal\fR to two (i.\ e. you have only two
groups), then the least significant bit of the hash value will be the \s-1XOR\s0 of
all least significant bits in the host name. One consequence is that when you
have two hosts, \*(L"server0.example.com\*(R" and \*(L"server1.example.com\*(R", where the host
name differs in one digit only and the digits differ by one, those hosts will
never end up in the same group.
.Sp
Available options:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBMatch\fR \fIMatch\fR \fITotal\fR" 4
.IX Item "Match Match Total"
Divide the data into \fITotal\fR groups and match all hosts in group \fIMatch\fR as
described above. The groups are numbered from zero, i.\ e. \fIMatch\fR must
be smaller than \fITotal\fR. \fITotal\fR must be at least one, although only values
greater than one really do make any sense.
.Sp
You can repeat this option to match multiple groups, for example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  Match 3 7
\&  Match 5 7
.Ve
.Sp
The above config will divide the data into seven groups and match groups three
and five. One use would be to keep every value on two hosts so that if one
fails the missing data can later be reconstructed from the second host.
