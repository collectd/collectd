=head1 NAME

collectd-nagios - Nagios plugin for querying collectd

=head1 SYNOPSIS

collectd-nagios B<-s> I<socket> B<-n> I<value_spec> B<-H> I<hostname> I<[options]>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This small program is the glue between collectd and nagios. collectd collects
various performance statistics which it provides via the C<unixsock plugin>,
see L<collectd-unixsock(5)>. This program is called by Nagios, connects to the
UNIX socket and reads the values from collectd. It then returns B<OKAY>,
B<WARNING> or B<CRITICAL> depending on the values and the ranges provided by
Nagios.

=head1 ARGUMENTS AND OPTIONS

The following arguments and options are required and understood by
collectd-nagios. The order of the arguments generally doesn't matter, as long
as no argument is passed more than once.

=over 4

=item B<-s> I<socket>

Path of the UNIX socket opened by collectd's C<unixsock plugin>.

=item B<-n> I<value_spec>

The value to read from collectd. The argument is in the form
C<plugin[-instance]/type[-instance]>.

=item B<-H> I<hostname>

Hostname to query the values for.

=item B<-d> I<data_source>

Each I<value_spec> may be made of multiple "data sources". With this option you
can select one or more data sources. To select multiple data sources simply
specify this option again. If multiple data sources are examined they are
handled according to the consolidation function given with the B<-g> option.

=item B<-g> B<none>I<|>B<average>I<|>B<sum>

When multiple data sources are selected from a value spec, they can be handled
differently depending on this option. The values of the following meaning:

=over 4

=item B<none>

No consolidation if done and the warning and critical regions are applied to
each value independently.

=item B<average>

The warning and critical ranges are applied to the average of all values.

=item B<sum>

The warning and critical ranges are applied to the sum of all values.

=item B<percentage>

The warning and critical ranges are applied to the ratio (in percent) of the
first value and the sum of all values. A warning is returned if the first
value is not defined or if all values sum up to zero.

=back

=item B<-c> I<range>

=item B<-w> I<range>

Set the critical (B<-c>) and warning (B<-w>) ranges. These options mostly
follow the normal syntax of Nagios plugins. The general format is
"I<min>B<:>I<max>". If a value is smaller than I<min> or bigger than I<max>, a
I<warning> or I<critical> status is returned, otherwise the status is
I<success>.

The tilde sign (B<~>) can be used to explicitly specify infinity. If B<~> is
used as a I<min> value, negative infinity is used. In case of I<max>, it is
interpreted as positive infinity.

If the first character of the I<range> is the atE<nbsp>sign (B<@>), the meaning
of the range will be inverted. I.E<nbsp>e. all values I<within> the range will
yield a I<warning> or I<critical> status, while all values I<outside> the range
will result in a I<success> status.

I<min> (and the colon) may be omitted,
I<min> is then assumed to be zero. If I<max> (but not the trailing colon) is
omitted, I<max> is assumed to be positive infinity.

=item B<-m>

If this option is given, "Not a Number" (NaN) is treated as I<critical>. By
default, the I<none> consolidation reports NaNs as I<warning>. Other
consolidations simply ignore NaN values.

=back

=head1 RETURN VALUE

As usual for Nagios plugins, this program writes a short, one line status
message to STDOUT and signals success or failure with it's return value. It
exits with a return value of B<0> for I<success>, B<1> for I<warning> and B<2>
for I<critical>. If the values are not available or some other error occurred,
it returns B<3> for I<unknown>.
