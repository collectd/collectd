=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<email plugin> opens an UNIX-socket over which one can submit email
statistics, such as the number of "ham", "spam", "virus", etc. mails
received/handled, spam scores and matched spam checks.

This plugin is intended to be used with the
L<Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin::Collectd> SpamAssassin-plugin which is included
in F<contrib/>, but is of course not limited to that use.

=head1 OPERATION

This plugin collects data indirectly by providing a UNIX-socket that external
programs can connect to. A simple line based protocol is used to communicate
with the plugin:

=over 4

=item

E-Mail type (e.g. "ham", "spam", "virus", ...) and size (bytes):

  e:<type>:<size>

If C<size> is less than or equal to zero, C<size> is ignored.

=item

Spam score:

  s:<value>

=item

Successful spam checks (e.g. "BAYES_99", "SUBJECT_DRUG_GAP_C", ...):

  c:<type1>[,<type2>,...]

Each line is limited to 256 characters (including the newline character). 
Longer lines will be ignored.
