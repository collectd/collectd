MongoDB C Driver Documentation
==============================

Overview
--------

The MongoDB C Driver is a 10gen-supported driver for MongoDB.
It's written in pure C. The goal is to be super strict for ultimate
portability, no dependencies, and generic embeddability.

The driver is still considered alpha but is undergoing active
development. Support for replica sets was just added in v0.3.1.
The API was completely revamped in v0.4.
Another backward-breaking change (support for `write_concern`) was added in v0.6.
Default write acknowledgement with mongo_client and BCON (BSON C Object Notation) were added in v0.7.
